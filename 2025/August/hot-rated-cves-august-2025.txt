BIG TCP introduced an IPV6_TLV_JUMBO IPv6 extension header to

feature is only enabled on devices that support BIG TCP TSO. The
header is only present for PF_PACKET taps like tcpdump, and not
transmitted by physical devices.

For this specific case of extension headers that are not
transmitted, return to the situation before the blamed commit
and support hardware offload.

CVE-2025-21647	hot	Linux	2025-01-19T10:18:04.415Z	sched: sch_cake: add bounds checks to host bulk flow fairness counts	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched: sch_cake: add bounds checks to host bulk flow fairness counts

Even though we fixed a logic error in the commit cited below, syzbot
still managed to trigger an underflow of the per-host bulk flow
counters, leading to an out of bounds memory access.

To avoid any such logic errors causing out of bounds memory accesses,
this commit factors out all accesses to the per-host bulk flow counters
to a series of helpers that perform bounds-checking before any
increments and decrements. This also has the benefit of improving
readability by moving the conditional checks for the flow mode into
these helpers, instead of having them spread out throughout the
code (which was the cause of the original logic error).

As part of this change, the flow quantum calculation is consolidated
into a helper function, which means that the dithering applied to the
ost load scaling is now applied both in the DRR rotation and when a
sparse flow's quantum is first initiated. The only user-visible effect
of this is that the maximum packet size that can be sent while a flow
stays sparse will now vary with +/- one byte in some cases. This should
not make a noticeable difference in practice, and thus it's not worth
complicating the code to preserve the old behaviour."	LINUX	Linux

net: fec: handle page_pool_dev_alloc_pages error

The fec_enet_update_cbd function calls page_pool_dev_alloc_pages but did
not handle the case when it returned NULL. There was a WARN_ON(!new_page)
but it would still proceed to use the NULL pointer and then crash.

This case does seem somewhat rare but when the system is under memory
pressure it can happen. One case where I can duplicate this with some
frequency is when writing over a smbd share to a SATA HDD attached to an
imx6q.

Setting /proc/sys/vm/min_free_kbytes to higher values also seems to solve
the problem for my test case. But it still seems wrong that the fec driver
ignores the memory allocation error and can crash.

This commit handles the allocation error by dropping the current packet."	LINUX	Linux

USB: serial: quatech2: fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb()

This patch addresses a null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() due to
an incorrect bounds check in the following:

       if (newport > serial->num_ports) {
               dev_err(&port->dev,
                       ""%s - port change to invalid port: %i\n"",
                       __func__, newport);
               break;
       }

The condition doesn't account for the valid range of the serial->port
buffer, which is from 0 to serial->num_ports - 1. When newport is equal
to serial->num_ports, the assignment of ""port"" in the
following code is out-of-bounds and NULL:

       serial_priv->current_port = newport;
       port = serial->port[serial_priv->current_port];

The fix checks if newport is greater than or equal to serial->num_ports
indicating it is out-of-bounds."	LINUX	Linux

usb: cdc-acm: Check control transfer buffer size before access

If the first fragment is shorter than struct usb_cdc_notification, we can't

instead of reading lengths from memory outside the received data, which can
lead to memory corruption when the expected_size decreases between
fragments, causing `expected_size - acm->nb_index` to wrap.

This issue has been present since the beginning of git history; however,
it only leads to memory corruption since commit ea2583529cd1
(""cdc-acm: reassemble fragmented notifications"").

A mitigating factor is that acm_ctrl_irq() can only execute after userspace
has opened /dev/ttyACM*; but if ModemManager is running, ModemManager will
do that automatically depending on the USB device's vendor/product IDs and
its other interfaces."	LINUX	Linux

MPTCP maintains the received sub-options status is the bitmask carrying

ata: libata-sff: Ensure that we cannot write outside the allocated buffer

reveliofuzzing reported that a SCSI_IOCTL_SEND_COMMAND ioctl with out_len
set to 0xd42, SCSI command set to ATA_16 PASS-THROUGH, ATA command set to
ATA_NOP, and protocol set to ATA_PROT_PIO, can cause ata_pio_sector() to
write outside the allocated buffer, overwriting random memory.

While a ATA device is supposed to abort a ATA_NOP command, there does seem
to be a bug either in libata-sff or QEMU, where either this status is not
set, or the status is cleared before read by ata_sff_hsm_move().
Anyway, that is most likely a separate bug.

Looking at __atapi_pio_bytes(), it already has a safety check to ensure
that __atapi_pio_bytes() cannot write outside the allocated buffer.

Add a similar check to ata_pio_sector(), such that also ata_pio_sector()
cannot write outside the allocated buffer."	LINUX	Linux

usbnet: ipheth: use static NDP16 location in URB

Original code allowed for the start of NDP16 to be anywhere within the
URB based on the `wNdpIndex` value in NTH16. Only the start position of
NDP16 was checked, so it was possible for even the fixed-length part
of NDP16 to extend past the end of URB, leading to an out-of-bounds
read.

On iOS devices, the NDP16 header always directly follows NTH16. Rely on
and check for this specific format.

This, along with NCM-specific minimal URB length check that already
exists, will ensure that the fixed-length part of NDP16 plus a set
amount of DPEs fit within the URB.

Note that this commit alone does not fully address the OoB read.
The limit on the amount of DPEs needs to be enforced separately."	LINUX	Linux

net/mlx5: HWS, change error flow on matcher disconnect

Currently, when firmware failure occurs during matcher disconnect flow,
the error flow of the function reconnects the matcher back and returns
an error, which continues running the calling function and eventually
frees the matcher that is being disconnected.
This leads to a case where we have a freed matcher on the matchers list,
which in turn leads to use-after-free and eventual crash.

This patch fixes that by not trying to reconnect the matcher back when
some FW command fails during disconnect.

Note that we're dealing here with FW error. We can't overcome this
problem. This might lead to bad steering state (e.g. wrong connection
between matchers), and will also lead to resource leakage, as it is
the case with any other error handling during resource destruction.

However, the goal here is to allow the driver to continue and not crash
the machine with use-after-free error."	LINUX	Linux

cgroup and autogroup migrations and scx_move_task() tried to filter out

The root cause is acpi_enable_all_wakeup_gpes() uses a mutex to protect
acpi_hw_enable_all_wakeup_gpes(), and acpi_ut_acquire_mutex() may cause
a thread switch. Since there is no longer concurrent execution during
loongarch_acpi_suspend(), we can call acpi_hw_enable_all_wakeup_gpes()
directly in enable_gpe_wakeup().

The solution is similar to commit 22db06337f590d01 (""ACPI: sleep: Avoid
breaking S3 wakeup due to might_sleep()"")."	LINUX	Linux
CVE-2025-21810	hot	Linux	2025-02-27T20:01:01.630Z	driver core: class: Fix wild pointer dereferences in API class_dev_iter_next()	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

driver core: class: Fix wild pointer dereferences in API class_dev_iter_next()

There are a potential wild pointer dereferences issue regarding APIs
class_dev_iter_(init|next|exit)(), as explained by below typical usage:

// All members of @iter are wild pointers.
struct class_dev_iter iter;

// class_dev_iter_init(@iter, @class, ...) checks parameter @class for
// potential class_to_subsys() error, and it returns void type and does
// not initialize its output parameter @iter, so caller can not detect
// the error and continues to invoke class_dev_iter_next(@iter) even if
// @iter still contains wild pointers.
class_dev_iter_init(&iter, ...);

// Dereference these wild pointers in @iter here once suffer the error.
while (dev = class_dev_iter_next(&iter)) { ... };

// Also dereference these wild pointers here.
class_dev_iter_exit(&iter);

Actually, all callers of these APIs have such usage pattern in kernel tree.
Fix by:
- Initialize output parameter @iter by memset() in class_dev_iter_init()
  and give callers prompt by pr_crit() for the error.
- Check if @iter is valid in class_dev_iter_next()."	LINUX	Linux

seccomp: passthrough uretprobe systemcall without filtering

When attaching uretprobes to processes running inside docker, the attached

The reason is that now that uretprobe is a system call the default seccomp
filters in docker block it as they only allow a specific set of known
syscalls. This is true for other userspace applications which use seccomp
to control their syscall surface.

Since uretprobe is a ""kernel implementation detail"" system call which is
not used by userspace application code directly, it is impractical and
there's very little point in forcing all userspace applications to
explicitly allow it in order to avoid crashing tracked processes.

Pass this systemcall through seccomp without depending on configuration.

CVE-2025-21839	hot	Linux	2025-03-07T09:09:58.220Z	KVM: x86: Load DR6 with guest value only before entering .vcpu_run() loop	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Load DR6 with guest value only before entering .vcpu_run() loop

Move the conditional loading of hardware DR6 with the guest's DR6 value
out of the core .vcpu_run() loop to fix a bug where KVM can load hardware
with a stale vcpu->arch.dr6.

When the guest accesses a DR and host userspace isn't debugging the guest,
KVM disables DR interception and loads the guest's values into hardware on
VM-Enter and saves them on VM-Exit.  This allows the guest to access DRs
at will, e.g. so that a sequence of DR accesses to configure a breakpoint
only generates one VM-Exit.

For DR0-DR3, the logic/behavior is identical between VMX and SVM, and also
identical between KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED (userspace debugging the guest)
and KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT (guest using DRs), and so KVM handles loading
DR0-DR3 in common code, _outside_ of the core kvm_x86_ops.vcpu_run() loop.

But for DR6, the guest's value doesn't need to be loaded into hardware for
KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED, and SVM provides a dedicated VMCB field whereas
VMX requires software to manually load the guest value, and so loading the
guest's value into DR6 is handled by {svm,vmx}_vcpu_run(), i.e. is done
_inside_ the core run loop.

Unfortunately, saving the guest values on VM-Exit is initiated by common
x86, again outside of the core run loop.  If the guest modifies DR6 (in
hardware, when DR interception is disabled), and then the next VM-Exit is
a fastpath VM-Exit, KVM will reload hardware DR6 with vcpu->arch.dr6 and
clobber the guest's actual value.

The bug shows up primarily with nested VMX because KVM handles the VMX
preemption timer in the fastpath, and the window between hardware DR6
being modified (in guest context) and DR6 being read by guest software is
orders of magnitude larger in a nested setup.  E.g. in non-nested, the
VMX preemption timer would need to fire precisely between #DB injection
and the #DB handler's read of DR6, whereas with a KVM-on-KVM setup, the
window where hardware DR6 is ""dirty"" extends all the way from L1 writing
DR6 to VMRESUME (in L1).

keys: Fix UAF in key_put()

Once a key's reference count has been reduced to 0, the garbage collector
thread may destroy it at any time and so key_put() is not allowed to touch
the key after that point.  The most key_put() is normally allowed to do is
to touch key_gc_work as that's a static global variable.

However, in an effort to speed up the reclamation of quota, this is now
done in key_put() once the key's usage is reduced to 0 - but now the code
is looking at the key after the deadline, which is forbidden.

Fix this by using a flag to indicate that a key can be gc'd now rather than

fuse: revert back to __readahead_folio() for readahead

In commit 3eab9d7bc2f4 (""fuse: convert readahead to use folios""), the
logic was converted to using the new folio readahead code, which drops
the reference on the folio once it is locked, using an inferred
reference on the folio. Previously we held a reference on the folio for
the entire duration of the readpages call.

This is fine, however for the case for splice pipe responses where we
will remove the old folio and splice in the new folio (see
fuse_try_move_page()), we assume that there is a reference held on the
folio for ap->folios, which is no longer the case.

To fix this, revert back to __readahead_folio() which allows us to hold
the reference on the folio for the duration of readpages until either we
drop the reference ourselves in fuse_readpages_end() or the reference is
dropped after it's replaced in the page cache in the splice case.
This will fix the UAF bug that was reported."	LINUX	Linux

net: ethtool: netlink: Allow NULL nlattrs when getting a phy_device

ethnl_req_get_phydev() is used to lookup a phy_device, in the case an
ethtool netlink command targets a specific phydev within a netdev's
topology.

It takes as a parameter a const struct nlattr *header that's used for
error handling :

       if (!phydev) {
               NL_SET_ERR_MSG_ATTR(extack, header,

               return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV);
       }

In the notify path after a ->set operation however, there's no request
attributes available.

The typical callsite for the above function looks like:

	phydev = ethnl_req_get_phydev(req_base, tb[ETHTOOL_A_XXX_HEADER],
				      info->extack);

So, when tb is NULL (such as in the ethnl notify path), we have a nice
crash.

It turns out that there's only the PLCA command that is in that case, as
the other phydev-specific commands don't have a notification.

This commit fixes the crash by passing the cmd index and the nlattr
array separately, allowing NULL-checking it directly inside the helper."	LINUX	Linux

The function currently frees the `driver_data` directly within the loop

Specifically, `hid_destroy_device()` uses `driver_data` when it calls

`driver_data` beforehand can result in accessing invalid memory.

module unload could fail to unregister/delete the device, leaving behind a

Since commit b36e4523d4d5 (""netfilter: nf_conncount: fix garbage
collection confirm race""), `cpu` and `jiffies32` were introduced to
the struct nf_conncount_tuple.

The commit made nf_conncount_add() initialize `conn->cpu` and
`conn->jiffies32` when allocating the struct.
In contrast, count_tree() was not changed to initialize them.

By commit 34848d5c896e (""netfilter: nf_conncount: Split insert and
traversal""), count_tree() was split and the relevant allocation
code now resides in insert_tree().
Initialize `conn->cpu` and `conn->jiffies32` in insert_tree().

positive value as a success due to commit 8511a2728ab8 (""dlm: fix use

Down the line, device_create_lockspace would pass that NULL lockspace to
dlm_find_lockspace_local, leading to a NULL pointer dereference.

CVE-2025-23145	hot	Linux	2025-05-01T12:55:34.622Z	mptcp: fix NULL pointer in can_accept_new_subflow	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mptcp: fix NULL pointer in can_accept_new_subflow

When testing valkey benchmark tool with MPTCP, the kernel panics in
'mptcp_can_accept_new_subflow' because subflow_req->msk is NULL.

Call trace:

  mptcp_can_accept_new_subflow (./net/mptcp/subflow.c:63 (discriminator 4)) (P)
  subflow_syn_recv_sock (./net/mptcp/subflow.c:854)

  ip_local_deliver (./net/ipv4/ip_input.c:254)
  ip_rcv_finish (./net/ipv4/ip_input.c:449)
  ...

According to the debug log, the same req received two SYN-ACK in a very
short time, very likely because the client retransmits the syn ack due
to multiple reasons.

Even if the packets are transmitted with a relevant time interval, they
can be processed by the server on different CPUs concurrently). The
'subflow_req->msk' ownership is transferred to the subflow the first,
and there will be a risk of a null pointer dereference here.

This patch fixes this issue by moving the 'subflow_req->msk' under the
`own_req == true` conditional.

Note that the !msk check in subflow_hmac_valid() can be dropped, because
the same check already exists under the own_req mpj branch where the
code has been moved to."	LINUX	Linux

Solr instances that (1) use the ""FileSystemConfigSetService"" component (the default in ""standalone"" or ""user-managed"" mode), and (2) are running without authentication and authorization are vulnerable to a sort of privilege escalation wherein individual ""trusted"" configset files can be ignored in favor of potentially-untrusted replacements available elsewhere on the filesystem.  These replacement config files are treated as ""trusted"" and can use ""<lib>"" tags to add to Solr's classpath, which an attacker might use to load malicious code as a searchComponent or other plugin.

This issue affects all Apache Solr versions up through Solr 9.7.  Users can protect against the vulnerability by enabling authentication and authorization on their Solr clusters or switching to SolrCloud (and away from ""FileSystemConfigSetService"").  Users are also recommended to upgrade to Solr 9.8.0, which mitigates this issue by disabling use of ""<lib>"" tags by default."

In versions on the 4.x branch prior to version 4.0.5, when parsing compact JWS or JWE input, Go JOSE could use excessive memory. The code used strings.Split(token, ""."") to split JWT tokens, which is vulnerable to excessive memory consumption when processing maliciously crafted tokens with a large number of `.` characters.  An attacker could exploit this by sending numerous malformed tokens, leading to memory exhaustion and a Denial of Service. Version 4.0.5 fixes this issue. As a workaround, applications could pre-validate that payloads passed to Go JOSE do not contain an excessive number of `.` characters."	GO-JOSE	go-jose

Apache Kafka Clients accept configuration data for setting the SASL/OAUTHBEARER connection with the brokers, including ""sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url"" and ""sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url"". Apache Kafka allows clients to read an arbitrary file and return the content in the error log, or sending requests to an unintended location. In applications where Apache Kafka Clients configurations can be specified by an untrusted party, attackers may use the ""sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url"" and ""sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url"" configuratin to read arbitrary contents of the disk and environment variables or make requests to an unintended location. In particular, this flaw may be used in Apache Kafka Connect to escalate from REST API access to filesystem/environment/URL access, which may be undesirable in certain environments, including SaaS products. 

Since Apache Kafka 3.9.1/4.0.0, we have added a system property (""-Dorg.apache.kafka.sasl.oauthbearer.allowed.urls"") to set the allowed urls in SASL JAAS configuration. In 3.9.1, it accepts all urls by default for backward compatibility. However in 4.0.0 and newer, the default value is empty list and users have to set the allowed urls explicitly."

In versions 1.3.3 and prior, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in CryptoLib's `Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity()` allows an attacker to craft a malicious TC frame that causes out-of-bounds memory writes. This can result in denial of service (DoS) or, under certain conditions, remote code execution (RCE). Any application or system that relies on CryptoLib for Telecommand (TC) processing and does not strictly validate incoming TC frames is at risk. This includes satellite ground stations or mission control software where attackers can inject malformed frames. A patch is available at commit c7e8a8745ff4b5e9bd7e500e91358e86d5abedcc."

A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in the `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted AOS frame with an insufficient length. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity`, specifically during the processing of the Frame Error Control Field (FECF). The affected code attempts to read from the `p_ingest` buffer at indices `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size - 2` and `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size - 1` without verifying if `len_ingest` is sufficiently large.

In versions 1.3.3 and prior, an unsigned integer underflow in the `Crypto_TC_ProcessSecurity` function of CryptoLib leads to a heap buffer overflow. The vulnerability is triggered when the `fl` (frame length) field in a Telecommand (TC) packet is set to 0. This underflow causes the frame length to be interpreted as 65535, resulting in out-of-bounds memory access. This critical vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) or potentially achieve remote code execution. Users of CryptoLib are advised to apply the recommended patch or avoid processing untrusted TC packets until a fix is available."	NASA	CryptoLib

The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD`, specifically during the computation of `tc_mac_start_index`. The affected code incorrectly calculates the MAC start index without ensuring it remains within the bounds of the `ingest` buffer. When `tc_mac_start_index` underflows due to an incorrect length calculation, the function attempts to access an out-of-bounds memory location, leading to a segmentation fault. The vulnerability is still present in the repository as of commit `d3cc420ace96d02a5b7e83d88cbd2e48010d5723`."	NASA	CryptoLib

CVE-2025-30165	hot	GitHub_M	2025-05-06T16:53:52.836Z	Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in vLLM Multi-Node Cluster Configuration	"vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models. In a multi-node vLLM deployment using the V0 engine, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The secondary vLLM hosts open a `SUB` ZeroMQ socket and connect to an `XPUB` socket on the primary vLLM host. When data is received on this `SUB` socket, it is deserialized with `pickle`. This is unsafe, as it can be abused to execute code on a remote machine. Since the vulnerability exists in a client that connects to the primary vLLM host, this vulnerability serves as an escalation point. If the primary vLLM host is compromised, this vulnerability could be used to compromise the rest of the hosts in the vLLM deployment. Attackers could also use other means to exploit the vulnerability without requiring access to the primary vLLM host. One example would be the use of ARP cache poisoning to redirect traffic to a malicious endpoint used to deliver a payload with arbitrary code to execute on the target machine. Note that this issue only affects the V0 engine, which has been off by default since v0.8.0. Further, the issue only applies to a deployment using tensor parallelism across multiple hosts, which we do not expect to be a common deployment pattern. Since V0 is has been off by default since v0.8.0 and the fix is fairly invasive, the maintainers of vLLM have decided not to fix this issue. Instead, the maintainers recommend that users ensure their environment is on a secure network in case this pattern is in use. The V1 engine is not affected by this issue."	VLLM-PROJECT	vllm

The Dpanel service contains a hardcoded JWT secret in its default configuration, allowing attackers to generate valid JWT tokens and compromise the host machine. This security flaw allows attackers to analyze the source code, discover the embedded secret, and craft legitimate JWT tokens. By forging these tokens, an attacker can successfully bypass authentication mechanisms, impersonate privileged users, and gain unauthorized administrative access. Consequently, this enables full control over the host machine, potentially leading to severe consequences such as sensitive data exposure, unauthorized command execution, privilege escalation, or further lateral movement within the network environment.

If the SIP ALG processes specifically formatted SIP invites, a memory corruption will occur which will lead to a crash of the FPC processing these packets. Although the system will automatically recover with the restart of the FPC, subsequent SIP invites will cause the crash again and lead to a sustained DoS.

A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account."

CVE-2025-32797	hot	GitHub_M	2025-06-16T18:46:31.227Z	Conda-build Insecure Build Script Permissions Enabling Arbitrary Code Execution	"Conda-build contains commands and tools to build conda packages. Prior to version 25.3.1, the write_build_scripts function in conda-build creates the temporary build script conda_build.sh with overly permissive file permissions (0o766), allowing write access to all users. Attackers with filesystem access can exploit a race condition to overwrite the script before execution, enabling arbitrary code execution under the victim's privileges. This risk is significant in shared environments, potentially leading to full system compromise. Even with non-static directory names, attackers can monitor parent directories for file creation events. The brief window between script creation (with insecure permissions) and execution allows rapid overwrites. Directory names can also be inferred via timestamps or logs, and automation enables exploitation even with semi-randomized paths by acting within milliseconds of detection. This issue has been patched in version 25.3.1. A workaround involves restricting conda_build.sh permissions from 0o766 to 0o700 (owner-only read/write/execute). Additionally, use atomic file creation (write to a temporary randomized filename and rename atomically) to minimize the race condition window."	CONDA	conda-build

Prior to version 25.4.0, the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently, conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result, the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions, conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code, violating security assumptions. This issue has been patched in version 25.4.0."

mei: vsc: Fix fortify-panic caused by invalid counted_by() use

gcc 15 honors the __counted_by(len) attribute on vsc_tp_packet.buf[]
and the vsc-tp.c code is using this in a wrong way. len does not contain
the available size in the buffer, it contains the actual packet length
*without* the crc. So as soon as vsc_tp_xfer() tries to add the crc to
buf[] the fortify-panic handler gets triggered:

fs/jfs: Prevent integer overflow in AG size calculation

The JFS filesystem calculates allocation group (AG) size using 1 <<
l2agsize in dbExtendFS(). When l2agsize exceeds 31 (possible with >2TB
aggregates on 32-bit systems), this 32-bit shift operation causes undefined
behavior and improper AG sizing.

On 32-bit architectures:
- Left-shifting 1 by 32+ bits results in 0 due to integer overflow
- This creates invalid AG sizes (0 or garbage values) in
sbi->bmap->db_agsize
- Subsequent block allocations would reference invalid AG structures
- Could lead to:
  - Filesystem corruption during extend operations
  - Kernel crashes due to invalid memory accesses
  - Security vulnerabilities via malformed on-disk structures

Fix by casting to s64 before shifting:
bmp->db_agsize = (s64)1 << l2agsize;

This ensures 64-bit arithmetic even on 32-bit architectures. The cast
matches the data type of db_agsize (s64) and follows similar patterns in

iommu/amd: Fix potential buffer overflow in parse_ivrs_acpihid

There is a string parsing logic error which can lead to an overflow of hid
or uid buffers. Comparing ACPIID_LEN against a total string length doesn't
take into account the lengths of individual hid and uid buffers so the
check is insufficient in some cases. For example if the length of hid
string is 4 and the length of the uid string is 260, the length of str
will be equal to ACPIID_LEN + 1 but uid string will overflow uid buffer
which size is 256.

The same applies to the hid string with length 13 and uid string with
length 250.

Check the length of hid and uid strings separately to prevent
buffer overflow.

struct devm_of_regulator_matches is populated with the stack allocated

PCI: endpoint: pci-epf-test: Fix double free that causes kernel to oops

Fix a kernel oops found while testing the stm32_pcie Endpoint driver
with handling of PERST# deassertion:

During EP initialization, pci_epf_test_alloc_space() allocates all BARs,
which are further freed if epc_set_bar() fails (for instance, due to no
free inbound window).

However, when pci_epc_set_bar() fails, the error path:

  pci_epc_set_bar() ->
    pci_epf_free_space()

does not clear the previous assignment to epf_test->reg[bar].

Then, if the host reboots, the PERST# deassertion restarts the BAR
allocation sequence with the same allocation failure (no free inbound
window), creating a double free situation since epf_test->reg[bar] was
deallocated and is still non-NULL.

Thus, make sure that pci_epf_alloc_space() and pci_epf_free_space()
invocations are symmetric, and as such, set epf_test->reg[bar] to NULL
when memory is freed.

If it's the first time the thread has processed an RPC, then that

The server sunrpc code treats a SVC_GARBAGE return from svc_authenticate

There is a potential crash issue when disabling and re-enabling the

device_link_del() to remove the device link, but it does not clear
phydev->devlink, so phydev->devlink is not a NULL pointer. Then the
network port is re-enabled, but if phy_attach_direct() fails before
calling device_link_add(), the code jumps to the ""error"" label and
calls phy_detach(). Since phydev->devlink retains the old value from
the previous attach/detach cycle, device_link_del() uses the old value,
which accesses a NULL pointer and causes a crash. The simplified crash

erofs: avoid using multiple devices with different type

For multiple devices, both primary and extra devices should be the
same type. `erofs_init_device` has already guaranteed that if the
primary is a file-backed device, extra devices should also be
regular files.

However, if the primary is a block device while the extra device
is a file-backed device, `erofs_init_device` will get an ENOTBLK,
which is not treated as an error in `erofs_fc_get_tree`, and that
leads to an UAF:

nvme-tcp: remove tag set when second admin queue config fails

Commit 104d0e2f6222 (""nvme-fabrics: reset admin connection for secure
concatenation"") modified nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() to call
nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() twice. The first call prepares for
DH-CHAP negotitation, and the second call is required for secure
concatenation. However, this change triggered BUG KASAN slab-use-after-
free in blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter(). This BUG can be recreated by
repeating the blktests test case nvme/063 a few times [1].

When the BUG happens, nvme_tcp_create_ctrl() fails in the call chain
below:

nvme_tcp_create_ctrl()
 nvme_tcp_alloc_ctrl() new=true             ... Alloc nvme_tcp_ctrl and admin_tag_set
 nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() new=true
  nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() new=true ... Succeed
   nvme_alloc_admin_tag_set()               ... Alloc the tag set for admin_tag_set

 nvme_uninit_ctrl()
 nvme_put_ctrl()                            ... Free up the nvme_tcp_ctrl and admin_tag_set

The first call of nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() succeeds with
new=true argument. The second call fails with new=false argument. This
second call does not call nvme_remove_admin_tag_set() on failure, due to
the new=false argument. Then the admin tag set is not removed. However,
nvme_tcp_create_ctrl() assumes that nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() would call
nvme_remove_admin_tag_set(). Then it frees up struct nvme_tcp_ctrl which
has admin_tag_set field. Later on, the timeout handler accesses the
admin_tag_set field and causes the BUG KASAN slab-use-after-free.

To not leave the admin tag set, call nvme_remove_admin_tag_set() when
the second nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() call fails. Do not return
from nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() on failure. Instead, jump to ""destroy_admin""
go-to label to call nvme_tcp_teardown_admin_queue() which calls

pinctrl: mediatek: eint: Fix invalid pointer dereference for v1 platforms

Commit 3ef9f710efcb (""pinctrl: mediatek: Add EINT support for multiple
addresses"") introduced an access to the 'soc' field of struct
mtk_pinctrl in mtk_eint_do_init() and for that an include of
pinctrl-mtk-common-v2.h.

However, pinctrl drivers relying on the v1 common driver include
pinctrl-mtk-common.h instead, which provides another definition of
struct mtk_pinctrl that does not contain an 'soc' field.

Since mtk_eint_do_init() can be called both by v1 and v2 drivers, it
will now try to dereference an invalid pointer when called on v1
platforms. This has been observed on Genio 350 EVK (MT8365), which
crashes very early in boot (the kernel trace can only be seen with
earlycon).

In order to fix this, since 'struct mtk_pinctrl' was only needed to get
a 'struct mtk_eint_pin', make 'struct mtk_eint_pin' a parameter
of mtk_eint_do_init() so that callers need to supply it, removing

net: ethernet: cortina: Use TOE/TSO on all TCP

It is desireable to push the hardware accelerator to also
process non-segmented TCP frames: we pass the skb->len
to the ""TOE/TSO"" offloader and it will handle them.

Without this quirk the driver becomes unstable and lock
up and and crash.

I do not know exactly why, but it is probably due to the
TOE (TCP offload engine) feature that is coupled with the
segmentation feature - it is not possible to turn one
part off and not the other, either both TOE and TSO are
active, or neither of them.

Not having the TOE part active seems detrimental, as if
that hardware feature is not really supposed to be turned
off.

The datasheet says:

  ""Based on packet parsing and TCP connection/NAT table
   lookup results, the NetEngine puts the packets
   belonging to the same TCP connection to the same queue
   for the software to process. The NetEngine puts
   incoming packets to the buffer or series of buffers
   for a jumbo packet. With this hardware acceleration,
   IP/TCP header parsing, checksum validation and
   connection lookup are offloaded from the software
   processing.""

After numerous tests with the hardware locking up after
something between minutes and hours depending on load
using iperf3 I have concluded this is necessary to stabilize
the hardware."	LINUX	Linux

usb: chipidea: udc: disconnect/reconnect from host when do suspend/resume

Shawn and John reported a hang issue during system suspend as below:

 - USB gadget is enabled as Ethernet
 - There is data transfer over USB Ethernet (scp a big file between host
                                             and device)
 - Device is going in/out suspend (echo mem > /sys/power/state)

The root cause is the USB device controller is suspended but the USB bus
is still active which caused the USB host continues to transfer data with
device and the device continues to queue USB requests (in this case, a
delayed TCP ACK packet trigger the issue) after controller is suspended,
however the USB controller clock is already gated off. Then if udc driver
access registers after that point, the system will hang.

The correct way to avoid such issue is to disconnect device from host when
the USB bus is not at suspend state. Then the host will receive disconnect
event and stop data transfer in time. To continue make USB gadget device
work after system resume, this will reconnect device automatically.

To make usb wakeup work if USB bus is already at suspend state, this will
keep connection for it only when USB device controller has enabled wakeup
capability."	LINUX	Linux

fs: export anon_inode_make_secure_inode() and fix secretmem LSM bypass

Export anon_inode_make_secure_inode() to allow KVM guest_memfd to create

This change also fixes a security regression in secretmem where the

LSM/SELinux checks to be bypassed for secretmem file descriptors.

As guest_memfd currently resides in the KVM module, we need to export this

Squashfs: check return result of sb_min_blocksize

Syzkaller reports an ""UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in squashfs_bio_read"" bug.

Syzkaller forks multiple processes which after mounting the Squashfs
filesystem, issues an ioctl(""/dev/loop0"", LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE, 0x8000). 
Now if this ioctl occurs at the same time another process is in the
process of mounting a Squashfs filesystem on /dev/loop0, the failure
occurs.  When this happens the following code in squashfs_fill_super()
fails.

----
msblk->devblksize = sb_min_blocksize(sb, SQUASHFS_DEVBLK_SIZE);
msblk->devblksize_log2 = ffz(~msblk->devblksize);
----

sb_min_blocksize() returns 0, which means msblk->devblksize is set to 0.

As a result, ffz(~msblk->devblksize) returns 64, and msblk->devblksize_log2
is set to 64.

This subsequently causes the

net/mlx5e: Fix race between DIM disable and net_dim()

There's a race between disabling DIM and NAPI callbacks using the dim
pointer on the RQ or SQ.

If NAPI checks the DIM state bit and sees it still set, it assumes
`rq->dim` or `sq->dim` is valid. But if DIM gets disabled right after
that check, the pointer might already be set to NULL, leading to a NULL
pointer dereference in net_dim().

Fix this by calling `synchronize_net()` before freeing the DIM context.
This ensures all in-progress NAPI callbacks are finished before the
pointer is cleared.

tcp: Correct signedness in skb remaining space calculation

Syzkaller reported a bug [1] where sk->sk_forward_alloc can overflow.

When we send data, if an skb exists at the tail of the write queue, the
kernel will attempt to append the new data to that skb. However, the code
that checks for available space in the skb is flawed:
'''
copy = size_goal - skb->len
'''

The types of the variables involved are:
'''
copy: ssize_t (s64 on 64-bit systems)
size_goal: int
skb->len: unsigned int
'''

Due to C's type promotion rules, the signed size_goal is converted to an
unsigned int to match skb->len before the subtraction. The result is an
unsigned int.

When this unsigned int result is then assigned to the s64 copy variable,
it is zero-extended, preserving its non-negative value. Consequently, copy
is always >= 0.

Assume we are sending 2GB of data and size_goal has been adjusted to a
value smaller than skb->len. The subtraction will result in copy holding a
very large positive integer. In the subsequent logic, this large value is
used to update sk->sk_forward_alloc, which can easily cause it to overflow.

The syzkaller reproducer uses TCP_REPAIR to reliably create this
condition. However, this can also occur in real-world scenarios. The
tcp_bound_to_half_wnd() function can also reduce size_goal to a small
value. This would cause the subsequent tcp_wmem_schedule() to set
sk->sk_forward_alloc to a value close to INT_MAX. Further memory
allocation requests would then cause sk_forward_alloc to wrap around and
become negative.

CVE-2025-38488	hot	Linux	2025-07-28T11:21:52.085Z	smb: client: fix use-after-free in crypt_message when using async crypto	"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

smb: client: fix use-after-free in crypt_message when using async crypto

The CVE-2024-50047 fix removed asynchronous crypto handling from
crypt_message(), assuming all crypto operations are synchronous.
However, when hardware crypto accelerators are used, this can cause
use-after-free crashes:

  crypt_message()
    // Allocate the creq buffer containing the req
    creq = smb2_get_aead_req(..., &req);

    // Async encryption returns -EINPROGRESS immediately
    rc = enc ? crypto_aead_encrypt(req) : crypto_aead_decrypt(req);

    // Free creq while async operation is still in progress
    kvfree_sensitive(creq, ...);

Hardware crypto modules often implement async AEAD operations for
performance. When crypto_aead_encrypt/decrypt() returns -EINPROGRESS,
the operation completes asynchronously. Without crypto_wait_req(),
the function immediately frees the request buffer, leading to crashes
when the driver later accesses the freed memory.

This results in a use-after-free condition when the hardware crypto
driver later accesses the freed request structure, leading to kernel
crashes with NULL pointer dereferences.

The issue occurs because crypto_alloc_aead() with mask=0 doesn't
guarantee synchronous operation. Even without CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC in
the mask, async implementations can be selected.

Fix by restoring the async crypto handling:
- DECLARE_CRYPTO_WAIT(wait) for completion tracking
- aead_request_set_callback() for async completion notification
- crypto_wait_req() to wait for operation completion

This ensures the request buffer isn't freed until the crypto operation
completes, whether synchronous or asynchronous, while preserving the
CVE-2024-50047 fix."	LINUX	Linux

bpf: Fix oob access in cgroup local storage

Lonial reported that an out-of-bounds access in cgroup local storage
can be crafted via tail calls. Given two programs each utilizing a
cgroup local storage with a different value size, and one program
doing a tail call into the other. The verifier will validate each of
the indivial programs just fine. However, in the runtime context
the bpf_cg_run_ctx holds an bpf_prog_array_item which contains the
BPF program as well as any cgroup local storage flavor the program
uses. Helpers such as bpf_get_local_storage() pick this up from the
runtime context:

  ctx = container_of(current->bpf_ctx, struct bpf_cg_run_ctx, run_ctx);

in an unintended out-of-bounds access.

net/sched: Restrict conditions for adding duplicating netems to qdisc tree

netem_enqueue's duplication prevention logic breaks when a netem
resides in a qdisc tree with other netems - this can lead to a
soft lockup and OOM loop in netem_dequeue, as seen in [1].
Ensure that a duplicating netem cannot exist in a tree with other
netems.

Previous approaches suggested in discussions in chronological order:

1) Track duplication status or ttl in the sk_buff struct. Considered
too specific a use case to extend such a struct, though this would
be a resilient fix and address other previous and potential future
DOS bugs like the one described in loopy fun [2].

2) Restrict netem_enqueue recursion depth like in act_mirred with a
per cpu variable. However, netem_dequeue can call enqueue on its
child, and the depth restriction could be bypassed if the child is a
netem.

3) Use the same approach as in 2, but add metadata in netem_skb_cb
to handle the netem_dequeue case and track a packet's involvement
in duplication. This is an overly complex approach, and Jamal
notes that the skb cb can be overwritten to circumvent this
safeguard.

4) Prevent the addition of a netem to a qdisc tree if its ancestral
path contains a netem. However, filters and actions can cause a
packet to change paths when re-enqueued to the root from netem
duplication, leading us to the current solution: prevent a
duplicating netem from inhabiting the same tree as other netems.

perf/core: Prevent VMA split of buffer mappings

The perf mmap code is careful about mmap()'ing the user page with the
ringbuffer and additionally the auxiliary buffer, when the event supports
it. Once the first mapping is established, subsequent mapping have to use
the same offset and the same size in both cases. The reference counting for
the ringbuffer and the auxiliary buffer depends on this being correct.

Though perf does not prevent that a related mapping is split via mmap(2),
munmap(2) or mremap(2). A split of a VMA results in perf_mmap_open() calls,
which take reference counts, but then the subsequent perf_mmap_close()
calls are not longer fulfilling the offset and size checks. This leads to
reference count leaks.

As perf already has the requirement for subsequent mappings to match the
initial mapping, the obvious consequence is that VMA splits, caused by
resizing of a mapping or partial unmapping, have to be prevented.

Implement the vm_operations_struct::may_split() callback and return
unconditionally -EINVAL.

fact. Remapping to a different fixed address with the same size is still

After successful allocation of a buffer or a successful attachment to an
existing buffer perf_mmap() tries to map the buffer read only into the page
table. If that fails, the already set up page table entries are zapped, but
the other perf specific side effects of that failure are not handled.  The
calling code just cleans up the VMA and does not invoke perf_mmap_close().

This leaks reference counts, corrupts user->vm accounting and also results
in an unbalanced invocation of event::event_mapped().

Cure this by moving the event::event_mapped() invocation before the
map_range() call so that on map_range() failure perf_mmap_close() can be
invoked without causing an unbalanced event::event_unmapped() call.

perf_mmap_close() undoes the reference counts and eventually frees buffers."	LINUX	Linux

When perf_mmap() fails to allocate a buffer, it still invokes the

the perf_rdpmc_allowed reference counter. But nothing undoes this as
perf_mmap_close() is never called in this case, which causes another
reference count leak.

ext4: fix inode use after free in ext4_end_io_rsv_work()

In ext4_io_end_defer_completion(), check if io_end->list_vec is empty to
avoid adding an io_end that requires no conversion to the
i_rsv_conversion_list, which in turn prevents starting an unnecessary
worker. An ext4_emergency_state() check is also added to avoid attempting
to abort the journal in an emergency state.

Additionally, ext4_put_io_end_defer() is refactored to call
ext4_io_end_defer_completion() directly instead of being open-coded.
This also prevents starting an unnecessary worker when EXT4_IO_END_FAILED
is set but data_err=abort is not enabled.

This ensures that the check in ext4_put_io_end_defer() is consistent with
the check in ext4_end_bio(). Otherwise, we might add an io_end to the

When a zoned loop device, or zloop device, is removed, KASAN enabled

nvmet: pci-epf: Do not complete commands twice if nvmet_req_init() fails

Have nvmet_req_init() and req->execute() complete failed commands.

Description of the problem:
nvmet_req_init() calls __nvmet_req_complete() internally upon failure,
e.g., unsupported opcode, which calls the ""queue_response"" callback,
this results in nvmet_pci_epf_queue_response() being called, which will
call nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() if data_len is 0 or if dma_dir is
different from DMA_TO_DEVICE. This results in a double completion as
nvmet_pci_epf_exec_iod_work() also calls nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod()
when nvmet_req_init() fails.

Steps to reproduce:
On the host send a command with an unsupported opcode with nvme-cli,
For example the admin command ""security receive""
$ sudo nvme security-recv /dev/nvme0n1 -n1 -x4096

This triggers a double completion as nvmet_req_init() fails and
nvmet_pci_epf_queue_response() is called, here iod->dma_dir is still
in the default state of ""DMA_NONE"" as set by default in
nvmet_pci_epf_alloc_iod(), so nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() is called.
Because nvmet_req_init() failed nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() is also
called in nvmet_pci_epf_exec_iod_work() leading to a double completion.
This not only sends two completions to the host but also corrupts the
state of the PCI NVMe target leading to kernel oops.

This patch lets nvmet_req_init() and req->execute() complete all failed
commands, and removes the double completion case in
nvmet_pci_epf_exec_iod_work() therefore fixing the edge cases where
double completions occurred."	LINUX	Linux

nfsd: allow SC_STATUS_FREEABLE when searching via nfs4_lookup_stateid()

The pynfs DELEG8 test fails when run against nfsd. It acquires a
delegation and then lets the lease time out. It then tries to use the
deleg stateid and expects to see NFS4ERR_DELEG_REVOKED, but it gets
bad NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID instead.

When a delegation is revoked, it's initially marked with
SC_STATUS_REVOKED, or SC_STATUS_ADMIN_REVOKED and later, it's marked
with the SC_STATUS_FREEABLE flag, which denotes that it is waiting for
s FREE_STATEID call.

nfs4_lookup_stateid() accepts a statusmask that includes the status
flags that a found stateid is allowed to have. Currently, that mask
never includes SC_STATUS_FREEABLE, which means that revoked delegations
are (almost) never found.

The vulnerability is due to inefficient regular expression complexity in the `SETTING_RE` variable within the `transformers/commands/chat.py` file. The regex contains repetition groups and non-optimized quantifiers, leading to exponential backtracking when processing 'almost matching' payloads. This can degrade application performance and potentially result in a denial-of-service (DoS) when handling specially crafted input strings. The issue is fixed in version 4.51.0."

In versions prior to 1.12.2, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the CoreDNS DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) server implementation. The server previously created a new goroutine for every incoming QUIC stream without imposing any limits on the number of concurrent streams or goroutines. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could open a large number of streams, leading to uncontrolled memory consumption and eventually causing an Out Of Memory (OOM) crash — especially in containerized or memory-constrained environments. The patch in version 1.12.2 introduces two key mitigation mechanisms: `max_streams`, which caps the number of concurrent QUIC streams per connection with a default value of `256`; and `worker_pool_size`, which Introduces a server-wide, bounded worker pool to process incoming streams with a default value of `1024`. This eliminates the 1:1 stream-to-goroutine model and ensures that CoreDNS remains resilient under high concurrency.  Some workarounds are available for those who are unable to upgrade. Disable QUIC support by removing or commenting out the `quic://` block in the Corefile, use container runtime resource limits to detect and isolate excessive memory usage, and/or monitor QUIC connection patterns and alert on anomalies."

CVE-2025-48384	hot	GitHub_M	2025-07-08T18:23:48.710Z	Git allows arbitrary code execution through broken config quoting	"Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1."	GIT	git
CVE-2025-48385	hot	GitHub_M	2025-07-08T18:23:44.405Z	Git alllows arbitrary file writes via bundle-uri parameter injection	"Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally fetch a bundle advertised by the remote server, which allows the server-side to offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection. This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched content is fully controlled by the server, which can in the worst case lead to arbitrary code execution. The use of bundle URIs is not enabled by default and can be controlled by the bundle.heuristic config option. Some cases of the vulnerability require that the adversary is in control of where a repository will be cloned to. This either requires social engineering or a recursive clone with submodules. These cases can thus be avoided by disabling recursive clones. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1."	GIT	git

CVE-2025-48952	hot	GitHub_M	2025-07-04T22:12:54.601Z	NetAlertX has Password Bypass Vulnerability due to Loose Comparison in PHP	"NetAlertX is a network, presence scanner, and alert framework. Prior to version 25.6.7, a vulnerability in the authentication logic allows users to bypass password verification using SHA-256 magic hashes, due to loose comparison in PHP. In vulnerable versions of the application, a password comparison is performed using the `==` operator at line 40 in front/index.php. This introduces a security issue where specially crafted ""magic hash"" values that evaluate to true in a loose comparison can bypass authentication. Because of the use of `==` instead of the strict `===`, different strings that begin with 0e and are followed by only digits can be interpreted as scientific notation (i.e., zero) and treated as equal. This issue falls under the Login Bypass vulnerability class. Users with certain ""weird"" passwords that produce magic hashes are particularly affected. Services relying on this logic are at risk of unauthorized access. Version 25.6.7 fixes the vulnerability."	JOKOB-SK	NetAlertX

 etc. Although OgnlRuntime attempts to restrict certain dangerous classes and methods (such as java.lang.Runtime) through a blocklist, these restrictions are not comprehensive. 
Attackers may be able to bypass the restrictions by leveraging class objects that are not covered by the blocklist and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution.

Fields in a Chart.yaml file, that are carried over to a Chart.lock file when dependencies are updated and this file is written, can be crafted in a way that can cause execution if that same content were in a file that is executed (e.g., a bash.rc file or shell script). If the Chart.lock file is symlinked to one of these files updating dependencies will write the lock file content to the symlinked file. This can lead to unwanted execution.

In versions 1.4.0 until 1.4.19, the file upload processing system contains an SSRF vulnerability that allows unauthenticated remote attackers to force the server to make arbitrary HTTP requests. The vulnerability stems from the multipart form data and JSON request handlers, which automatically download files from user-provided URLs without validating whether those URLs point to internal network addresses, cloud metadata endpoints, or other restricted resources. The documentation explicitly promotes this URL-based file upload feature, making it an intended design that exposes all deployed services to SSRF attacks by default. Version 1.4.19 contains a patch for the issue."	BENTOML	BentoML

In versions 2.11.27 and below, 3.0.0 through 3.4.4 and 3.5.0-rc1, a path traversal vulnerability was discovered in WASM Traefik’s plugin installation mechanism.

A command injection vulnerability present in versions prior to 4.6.2 affects applications that use the ImageMagick handler for image processing (`imagick` as the image library) and either allow file uploads with user-controlled filenames and process uploaded images using the `resize()` method or use the `text()` method with user-controlled text content or options. An attacker can upload a file with a malicious filename containing shell metacharacters that get executed when the image is processed or provide malicious text content or options that get executed when adding text to images Users should upgrade to v4.6.2 or later to receive a patch. As a workaround, switch to the GD image handler (`gd`, the default handler), which is not affected by either vulnerability. For file upload scenarios, instead of using user-provided filenames, generate random names to eliminate the attack vector with `getRandomName()` when using the `move()` method, or use the `store()` method, which automatically generates safe filenames. For text operations, if one must use ImageMagick with user-controlled text, sanitize the input to only allow safe characters and validate/restrict text options."	CODEIGNITER4	CodeIgniter4

In versions 1.16.1 and below, a critical security vulnerability exists in password handling mechanisms. During encrypted sandbox creation, user passwords are transmitted via shared memory, exposing them to potential interception. The vulnerability is particularly severe during password modification operations, where both old and new passwords are passed as plaintext command-line arguments to the Imbox process without any encryption or obfuscation. This implementation flaw allows any process within the user session, including unprivileged processes, to retrieve these sensitive credentials by reading the command-line arguments, thereby bypassing standard privilege requirements and creating a significant security risk.

A heap buffer overflow vulnerability exists in NASA CryptoLib version 1.4.0 and prior in the IV setup logic for telecommand frames. The problem arises from missing bounds checks when copying the Initialization Vector (IV) into a freshly allocated buffer. An attacker can supply a crafted TC frame that causes the library to write one byte past the end of the heap buffer, leading to heap corruption and undefined behaviour. An attacker supplying a malformed telecommand frame can corrupt heap memory. This leads to undefined behaviour, which could manifest itself as a crash (denial of service) or more severe exploitation.

The function itself validates the index value to ensure it isn't bigger than the maximum value allowed. However, it fails to validate the lower bound, allowing the index parameter to be a negative value.

This can lead to execution of a wide range of privileged commands to the engine API, including controlling other containers, creating new ones, managing images etc. In some circumstances (e.g. Docker Desktop for Windows with WSL backend) it also allows mounting the host drive with the same privileges as the user running Docker Desktop."

CVE-2025-9190	hot	CERT-PL	2025-08-26T12:22:59.617Z	TCC Bypass via misconfigured Node fuses in Cursor	"The configuration of Cursor on macOS, specifically the ""RunAsNode"" fuse enabled, allows a local attacker with unprivileged access to execute arbitrary code that inherits Cursor TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permissions. 
Acquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Accessing other resources beyond previously granted TCC permissions will prompt the user for approval in the name of Cursor, potentially disguising attacker's malicious intent. 

This issue was detected in 15.4.1 version of Cursor. Project maintainers decided not to fix this issue, because a scenario including a local attacker falls outside their defined threat model."	CURSOR	Cursor

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Microsoft Windows. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

The specific flaw exists within the handling of .LNK files. Crafted data in an .LNK file can cause hazardous content in the file to be invisible to a user who inspects the file via the Windows-provided user interface. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-25373."	MICROSOFT	Windows
