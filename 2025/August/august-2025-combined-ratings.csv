The Stats application is vulnerable to a local privilege escalation due to the insecure implementation of its XPC service. The application registers a Mach service under the name `eu.exelban.Stats.SMC.Helper`. The associated binary, eu.exelban.Stats.SMC.Helper, is a privileged helper tool designed to execute actions requiring elevated privileges on behalf of the client, such as setting fan modes, adjusting fan speeds, and executing the `powermetrics` command. The root cause of this vulnerability lies in the `shouldAcceptNewConnection` method, which unconditionally returns YES (or true), allowing any XPC client to connect to the service without any form of verification. As a result, unauthorized clients can establish a connection to the Mach service and invoke methods exposed by the HelperTool interface. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to modify the hardware settings of the user’s device and execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

net: reenable NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM offload for BIG TCP packets

The blamed commit disabled hardware offoad of IPv6 packets with
extension headers on devices that advertise NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM,
based on the definition of that feature in skbuff.h:

 *   * - %NETIF_F_IPV6_CSUM
 *     - Driver (device) is only able to checksum plain
 *       TCP or UDP packets over IPv6. These are specifically
 *       unencapsulated packets of the form IPv6|TCP or
 *       IPv6|UDP where the Next Header field in the IPv6
 *       header is either TCP or UDP. IPv6 extension headers
 *       are not supported with this feature. This feature
 *       cannot be set in features for a device with
 *       NETIF_F_HW_CSUM also set. This feature is being
 *       DEPRECATED (see below).

The change causes skb_warn_bad_offload to fire for BIG TCP
packets.

communicate packet length, as this is an IPv6 jumbogram. But, the
feature is only enabled on devices that support BIG TCP TSO. The
header is only present for PF_PACKET taps like tcpdump, and not
transmitted by physical devices.

For this specific case of extension headers that are not
transmitted, return to the situation before the blamed commit

CVE-2025-21647,PUBLISHED,Linux,2025-01-19T10:18:04.415Z,sched: sch_cake: add bounds checks to host bulk flow fairness counts,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

sched: sch_cake: add bounds checks to host bulk flow fairness counts

Even though we fixed a logic error in the commit cited below, syzbot
still managed to trigger an underflow of the per-host bulk flow
counters, leading to an out of bounds memory access.

To avoid any such logic errors causing out of bounds memory accesses,
this commit factors out all accesses to the per-host bulk flow counters
to a series of helpers that perform bounds-checking before any
increments and decrements. This also has the benefit of improving
readability by moving the conditional checks for the flow mode into
these helpers, instead of having them spread out throughout the
code (which was the cause of the original logic error).

As part of this change, the flow quantum calculation is consolidated
into a helper function, which means that the dithering applied to the
ost load scaling is now applied both in the DRR rotation and when a
sparse flow's quantum is first initiated. The only user-visible effect
of this is that the maximum packet size that can be sent while a flow
stays sparse will now vary with +/- one byte in some cases. This should
not make a noticeable difference in practice, and thus it's not worth
complicating the code to preserve the old behaviour.",LINUX,Linux,hot

USB: serial: quatech2: fix null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb()

This patch addresses a null-ptr-deref in qt2_process_read_urb() due to
an incorrect bounds check in the following:

       if (newport > serial->num_ports) {
               dev_err(&port->dev,
                       ""%s - port change to invalid port: %i\n"",
                       __func__, newport);
               break;
       }

The condition doesn't account for the valid range of the serial->port
buffer, which is from 0 to serial->num_ports - 1. When newport is equal
to serial->num_ports, the assignment of ""port"" in the
following code is out-of-bounds and NULL:

       serial_priv->current_port = newport;
       port = serial->port[serial_priv->current_port];

The fix checks if newport is greater than or equal to serial->num_ports
indicating it is out-of-bounds.",LINUX,Linux,hot

net/mlx5: HWS, change error flow on matcher disconnect

Currently, when firmware failure occurs during matcher disconnect flow,
the error flow of the function reconnects the matcher back and returns
an error, which continues running the calling function and eventually
frees the matcher that is being disconnected.
This leads to a case where we have a freed matcher on the matchers list,
which in turn leads to use-after-free and eventual crash.

This patch fixes that by not trying to reconnect the matcher back when
some FW command fails during disconnect.

Note that we're dealing here with FW error. We can't overcome this
problem. This might lead to bad steering state (e.g. wrong connection
between matchers), and will also lead to resource leakage, as it is
the case with any other error handling during resource destruction.

sched_ext: Fix incorrect autogroup migration detection

scx_move_task() is called from sched_move_task() and tells the BPF scheduler
that cgroup migration is being committed. sched_move_task() is used by both
cgroup and autogroup migrations and scx_move_task() tried to filter out
autogroup migrations by testing the destination cgroup and PF_EXITING but
this is not enough. In fact, without explicitly tagging the thread which is
doing the cgroup migration, there is no good way to tell apart
scx_move_task() invocations for racing migration to the root cgroup and an
autogroup migration.

This led to scx_move_task() incorrectly ignoring a migration from non-root
cgroup to an autogroup of the root cgroup triggering the following warning:

class_dev_iter_(init|next|exit)(), as explained by below typical usage:

// All members of @iter are wild pointers.
struct class_dev_iter iter;

// class_dev_iter_init(@iter, @class, ...) checks parameter @class for

seccomp: passthrough uretprobe systemcall without filtering

When attaching uretprobes to processes running inside docker, the attached
process is segfaulted when encountering the retprobe.

The reason is that now that uretprobe is a system call the default seccomp
filters in docker block it as they only allow a specific set of known
syscalls. This is true for other userspace applications which use seccomp
to control their syscall surface.

Since uretprobe is a ""kernel implementation detail"" system call which is
not used by userspace application code directly, it is impractical and
there's very little point in forcing all userspace applications to
explicitly allow it in order to avoid crashing tracked processes.

Pass this systemcall through seccomp without depending on configuration.

Note: uretprobe is currently only x86_64 and isn't expected to ever be
supported in i386.

KVM: x86: Load DR6 with guest value only before entering .vcpu_run() loop

Move the conditional loading of hardware DR6 with the guest's DR6 value
out of the core .vcpu_run() loop to fix a bug where KVM can load hardware
with a stale vcpu->arch.dr6.

When the guest accesses a DR and host userspace isn't debugging the guest,
KVM disables DR interception and loads the guest's values into hardware on
VM-Enter and saves them on VM-Exit.  This allows the guest to access DRs
at will, e.g. so that a sequence of DR accesses to configure a breakpoint
only generates one VM-Exit.

For DR0-DR3, the logic/behavior is identical between VMX and SVM, and also
identical between KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED (userspace debugging the guest)
and KVM_DEBUGREG_WONT_EXIT (guest using DRs), and so KVM handles loading
DR0-DR3 in common code, _outside_ of the core kvm_x86_ops.vcpu_run() loop.

But for DR6, the guest's value doesn't need to be loaded into hardware for
KVM_DEBUGREG_BP_ENABLED, and SVM provides a dedicated VMCB field whereas
VMX requires software to manually load the guest value, and so loading the
guest's value into DR6 is handled by {svm,vmx}_vcpu_run(), i.e. is done
_inside_ the core run loop.

Unfortunately, saving the guest values on VM-Exit is initiated by common
x86, again outside of the core run loop.  If the guest modifies DR6 (in
hardware, when DR interception is disabled), and then the next VM-Exit is
a fastpath VM-Exit, KVM will reload hardware DR6 with vcpu->arch.dr6 and
clobber the guest's actual value.

The bug shows up primarily with nested VMX because KVM handles the VMX
preemption timer in the fastpath, and the window between hardware DR6
being modified (in guest context) and DR6 being read by guest software is
orders of magnitude larger in a nested setup.  E.g. in non-nested, the
VMX preemption timer would need to fire precisely between #DB injection
and the #DB handler's read of DR6, whereas with a KVM-on-KVM setup, the
window where hardware DR6 is ""dirty"" extends all the way from L1 writing
DR6 to VMRESUME (in L1).

In commit 3eab9d7bc2f4 (""fuse: convert readahead to use folios""), the
logic was converted to using the new folio readahead code, which drops
the reference on the folio once it is locked, using an inferred
reference on the folio. Previously we held a reference on the folio for
the entire duration of the readpages call.

This is fine, however for the case for splice pipe responses where we
will remove the old folio and splice in the new folio (see
fuse_try_move_page()), we assume that there is a reference held on the
folio for ap->folios, which is no longer the case.

To fix this, revert back to __readahead_folio() which allows us to hold
the reference on the folio for the duration of readpages until either we
drop the reference ourselves in fuse_readpages_end() or the reference is
dropped after it's replaced in the page cache in the splice case.
This will fix the UAF bug that was reported.",LINUX,Linux,hot

net: ethtool: netlink: Allow NULL nlattrs when getting a phy_device

ethnl_req_get_phydev() is used to lookup a phy_device, in the case an
ethtool netlink command targets a specific phydev within a netdev's
topology.

It takes as a parameter a const struct nlattr *header that's used for
error handling :

       if (!phydev) {
               NL_SET_ERR_MSG_ATTR(extack, header,
                                   ""no phy matching phyindex"");
               return ERR_PTR(-ENODEV);
       }

In the notify path after a ->set operation however, there's no request
attributes available.

The typical callsite for the above function looks like:

	phydev = ethnl_req_get_phydev(req_base, tb[ETHTOOL_A_XXX_HEADER],
				      info->extack);

So, when tb is NULL (such as in the ethnl notify path), we have a nice
crash.

It turns out that there's only the PLCA command that is in that case, as
the other phydev-specific commands don't have a notification.

This commit fixes the crash by passing the cmd index and the nlattr
array separately, allowing NULL-checking it directly inside the helper.",LINUX,Linux,hot

mptcp: fix NULL pointer in can_accept_new_subflow

When testing valkey benchmark tool with MPTCP, the kernel panics in
'mptcp_can_accept_new_subflow' because subflow_req->msk is NULL.

Call trace:

  mptcp_can_accept_new_subflow (./net/mptcp/subflow.c:63 (discriminator 4)) (P)

According to the debug log, the same req received two SYN-ACK in a very
short time, very likely because the client retransmits the syn ack due
to multiple reasons.

Even if the packets are transmitted with a relevant time interval, they
can be processed by the server on different CPUs concurrently). The
'subflow_req->msk' ownership is transferred to the subflow the first,
and there will be a risk of a null pointer dereference here.

This patch fixes this issue by moving the 'subflow_req->msk' under the
`own_req == true` conditional.

Note that the !msk check in subflow_hmac_valid() can be dropped, because
the same check already exists under the own_req mpj branch where the
code has been moved to.",LINUX,Linux,hot

When receiving a data packet from an unknown IP address/port combination, fastd will assume that one of its connected peers has moved to a new address and initiate a reconnect by sending a handshake packet. This ""fast reconnect"" avoids having to wait for a session timeout (up to ~90s) until a new connection is established. Even a 1-byte UDP packet just containing the fastd packet type header can trigger a much larger handshake packet (~150 bytes of UDP payload). Including IPv4 and UDP headers, the resulting amplification factor is roughly 12-13.

CVE-2025-24814,PUBLISHED,apache,2025-01-27T08:58:08.768Z,"Apache Solr: Core-creation with ""trusted"" configset can use arbitrary untrusted files","Core creation allows users to replace ""trusted"" configset files with arbitrary configuration

Solr instances that (1) use the ""FileSystemConfigSetService"" component (the default in ""standalone"" or ""user-managed"" mode), and (2) are running without authentication and authorization are vulnerable to a sort of privilege escalation wherein individual ""trusted"" configset files can be ignored in favor of potentially-untrusted replacements available elsewhere on the filesystem.  These replacement config files are treated as ""trusted"" and can use ""<lib>"" tags to add to Solr's classpath, which an attacker might use to load malicious code as a searchComponent or other plugin.

This issue affects all Apache Solr versions up through Solr 9.7.  Users can protect against the vulnerability by enabling authentication and authorization on their Solr clusters or switching to SolrCloud (and away from ""FileSystemConfigSetService"").  Users are also recommended to upgrade to Solr 9.8.0, which mitigates this issue by disabling use of ""<lib>"" tags by default.",APACHE,Apache Solr,hot

CVE-2025-24889,PUBLISHED,GitHub_M,2025-02-13T17:34:36.991Z,Path traversal in sd-log Qubes virtual machine,"The SecureDrop Client is a desktop application for journalists to communicate with sources and work with submissions on the SecureDrop Workstation. Prior to versions 0.14.1 and 1.0.1, an attacker who has already gained code execution in a virtual machine on the SecureDrop Workstation could gain code execution in the `sd-log` virtual machine by sending a specially crafted log entry. The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and requires an attacker to already have code execution on one of the other virtual machines (VMs) of the system. Due to the Workstation's underlying usage of Qubes for strong isolation, the vulnerability would have allowed lateral movement between any log-enabled VM and the `sd-log` VM, but no further. The SecureDrop workstation collects logs centrally in an isolated virtual machine named `sd-log` for easy export for support and debugging purposes. The `sd-log`  VM is completely isolated from the internet and ingests logs via a narrow Qubes RPC policy that allows for specific inter-VM communication via the Xen vchan protocol used by Qubes's qrexec mechanism. A path traversal bug was found in the logic used to choose where to write the log file for a specific VM: the VM name, used unsanitized in the destination path in `sd-log`, is supplied by the logging VM itself instead of being read from a trusted source, such as the Qubes environment variable `QREXEC_REMOTE_DOMAIN` that is used in the fixed implementation. An attacker could provide an arbitrary source VM name, possibly overwriting logs of other VMs, or writing a file named `syslog.log`, with attacker-controlled content, in arbitrary directories as a low-privileged user. A successful attack could potentially overwrite or add configuration to software that loads configuration files from a directory. This is exploitable to achieve code execution by setting the target directory to `/home/user/.config/autostart/` and letting it write `syslog.log`, because XFCE treats any file in that directory as a `.desktop` file regardless of its extension. Versions 0.14.1 and 1.0.1 contain a patch for this issue.",FREEDOMOFPRESS,securedrop-client,warm

This could cause the server to crash or to return arbitrary memory contents to the client.

CVE-2025-25284,PUBLISHED,GitHub_M,2025-02-18T18:42:55.190Z,Path Traversal and Local File Read via VRT (Virtual Format) in ZOO-Project WPS Implementation,"The ZOO-Project is an open source processing platform, released under MIT/X11 Licence. A vulnerability in ZOO-Project's WPS (Web Processing Service) implementation allows unauthorized access to files outside the intended directory through path traversal. Specifically, the Gdal_Translate service, when processing VRT (Virtual Format) files, does not properly validate file paths referenced in the VRTRasterBand element, allowing attackers to read arbitrary files on the system. The vulnerability exists because the service doesn't properly sanitize the SourceFilename parameter in VRT files, allowing relative path traversal sequences (../). When combined with VRT's raw data handling capabilities, this allows reading arbitrary files as raw binary data and converting them to TIFF format, effectively exposing their contents. This vulnerability is particularly severe because it allows attackers to read sensitive system files, potentially exposing configuration data, credentials, or other confidential information stored on the server. An unauthenticated attacker can read arbitrary files from the system through path traversal, potentially accessing sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data stored on the server. The vulnerability requires no authentication and can be exploited remotely through the WPS service. This issue has been addressed in commit `5f155a8` and all users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.",ZOO-PROJECT,ZOO-Project,warm
CVE-2025-25296,PUBLISHED,GitHub_M,2025-02-14T19:24:03.961Z,Label Studio allows Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via GET request to `/projects/upload-example` endpoint,"Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. Prior to version 1.16.0, Label Studio's `/projects/upload-example` endpoint allows injection of arbitrary HTML through a `GET` request with an appropriately crafted `label_config` query parameter. By crafting a specially formatted XML label config with inline task data containing malicious HTML/JavaScript, an attacker can achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). While the application has a Content Security Policy (CSP), it is only set in report-only mode, making it ineffective at preventing script execution. The vulnerability exists because the upload-example endpoint renders user-provided HTML content without proper sanitization on a GET request. This allows attackers to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in victims' browsers by getting them to visit a maliciously crafted URL. This is considered vulnerable because it enables attackers to execute JavaScript in victims' contexts, potentially allowing theft of sensitive data, session hijacking, or other malicious actions. Version 1.16.0 contains a patch for the issue.",HUMANSIGNAL,label-studio,warm
CVE-2025-25297,PUBLISHED,GitHub_M,2025-02-14T19:25:50.893Z,Label Studio allows Server-Side Request Forgery in the S3 Storage Endpoint,"Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. Prior to version 1.16.0, Label Studio's S3 storage integration feature contains a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in its endpoint configuration. When creating an S3 storage connection, the application allows users to specify a custom S3 endpoint URL via the s3_endpoint parameter. This endpoint URL is passed directly to the boto3 AWS SDK without proper validation or restrictions on the protocol or destination. The vulnerability allows an attacker to make the application send HTTP requests to arbitrary internal services by specifying them as the S3 endpoint. When the storage sync operation is triggered, the application attempts to make S3 API calls to the specified endpoint, effectively making HTTP requests to the target service and returning the response in error messages. This SSRF vulnerability enables attackers to bypass network segmentation and access internal services that should not be accessible from the external network. The vulnerability is particularly severe because error messages from failed requests contain the full response body, allowing data exfiltration from internal services. Version 1.16.0 contains a patch for the issue.",HUMANSIGNAL,label-studio,warm

CVE-2025-27136,PUBLISHED,GitHub_M,2025-03-10T18:24:38.743Z,LocalS3 CreateBucketConfiguration Endpoint XML External Entity (XXE) Injection,"LocalS3 is an Amazon S3 mock service for testing and local development. Prior to version 1.21, the LocalS3 service's bucket creation endpoint is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) injection. When processing the CreateBucketConfiguration XML document during bucket creation, the service's XML parser is configured to resolve external entities. This allows an attacker to declare an external entity that references an internal URL, which the server will then attempt to fetch when parsing the XML. The vulnerability specifically occurs in the location constraint processing, where the XML parser resolves external entities without proper validation or restrictions. When the external entity is resolved, the server makes an HTTP request to the specified URL and includes the response content in the parsed XML document. This vulnerability can be exploited to perform server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, allowing an attacker to make requests to internal services or resources that should not be accessible from external networks. The server will include the responses from these internal requests in the resulting bucket configuration, effectively leaking sensitive information. The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the LocalS3 service to exploit this vulnerability.",ROBOTHY,local-s3,warm

Prior to version 1.1.21, the application is vulnerable to an open redirect due to improper validation of the callbackURL parameter in the email verification endpoint and any other endpoint that accepts callback url. While the server blocks fully qualified URLs, it incorrectly allows scheme-less URLs. This results in the browser interpreting the URL as a fully qualified URL, leading to unintended redirection. An attacker can exploit this flaw by crafting a malicious verification link and tricking users into clicking it. Upon successful email verification, the user will be automatically redirected to the attacker's website, which can be used for phishing, malware distribution, or stealing sensitive authentication tokens.

In a Kubernetes environment, Ratify can be configured to authenticate to a private Azure Container Registry (ACR). The Azure workload identity and Azure managed identity authentication providers are configured in this setup. Users that configure a private ACR to be used with the Azure authentication providers may be impacted by a vulnerability that exists in versions prior to 1.2.3 and 1.3.2. Both Azure authentication providers attempt to exchange an Entra ID (EID) token for an ACR refresh token. However, Ratify’s Azure authentication providers did not verify that the target registry is an ACR. This could have led to the EID token being presented to a non-ACR registry during token exchange. EID tokens with ACR access can potentially be extracted and abused if a user workload contains an image reference to a malicious registry. As of versions 1.2.3 and 1.3.2, the Azure workload identity and Azure managed identity authentication providers are updated to add new validation prior to EID token exchange. Validation relies upon registry domain validation against a pre-configured list of well-known ACR endpoints. EID token exchange will be executed only if at least one of the configured well-known domain suffixes (wildcard support included) matches the registry domain of the image reference.",RATIFY-PROJECT,ratify,warm

Apache Kafka Clients accept configuration data for setting the SASL/OAUTHBEARER connection with the brokers, including ""sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url"" and ""sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url"". Apache Kafka allows clients to read an arbitrary file and return the content in the error log, or sending requests to an unintended location. In applications where Apache Kafka Clients configurations can be specified by an untrusted party, attackers may use the ""sasl.oauthbearer.token.endpoint.url"" and ""sasl.oauthbearer.jwks.endpoint.url"" configuratin to read arbitrary contents of the disk and environment variables or make requests to an unintended location. In particular, this flaw may be used in Apache Kafka Connect to escalate from REST API access to filesystem/environment/URL access, which may be undesirable in certain environments, including SaaS products.

CVE-2025-29780,PUBLISHED,GitHub_M,2025-03-14T17:26:58.453Z,Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing has Timing Side-Channels in Matrix Operations,"Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing provides a Python implementation of Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. In versions 0.8.0b2 and prior, the `feldman_vss` library contains timing side-channel vulnerabilities in its matrix operations, specifically within the `_find_secure_pivot` function and potentially other parts of `_secure_matrix_solve`. These vulnerabilities are due to Python's execution model, which does not guarantee constant-time execution. An attacker with the ability to measure the execution time of these functions (e.g., through repeated calls with carefully crafted inputs) could potentially recover secret information used in the Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) scheme. The `_find_secure_pivot` function, used during Gaussian elimination in `_secure_matrix_solve`, attempts to find a non-zero pivot element. However, the conditional statement `if matrix[row][col] != 0 and row_random < min_value:` has execution time that depends on the value of `matrix[row][col]`. This timing difference can be exploited by an attacker. The `constant_time_compare` function in this file also does not provide a constant-time guarantee. The Python implementation of matrix operations in the _find_secure_pivot and _secure_matrix_solve functions cannot guarantee constant-time execution, potentially leaking information about secret polynomial coefficients. An attacker with the ability to make precise timing measurements of these operations could potentially extract secret information through statistical analysis of execution times, though practical exploitation would require significant expertise and controlled execution environments. Successful exploitation of these timing side-channels could allow an attacker to recover secret keys or other sensitive information protected by the VSS scheme. This could lead to a complete compromise of the shared secret. As of time of publication, no patched versions of Post-Quantum Secure Feldman's Verifiable Secret Sharing exist, but other mitigations are available. As acknowledged in the library's documentation, these vulnerabilities cannot be adequately addressed in pure Python. In the short term, consider using this library only in environments where timing measurements by attackers are infeasible. In the medium term, implement your own wrappers around critical operations using constant-time libraries in languages like Rust, Go, or C. In the long term, wait for the planned Rust implementation mentioned in the library documentation that will properly address these issues.",DAVIDOSIPOV,PostQuantum-Feldman-VSS,warm

CVE-2025-29909,PUBLISHED,GitHub_M,2025-03-17T21:55:14.979Z,CryptoLib's Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity() Has a Heap Buffer Overflow Vulnerability,"CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In versions 1.3.3 and prior, a heap buffer overflow vulnerability in CryptoLib's `Crypto_TC_ApplySecurity()` allows an attacker to craft a malicious TC frame that causes out-of-bounds memory writes. This can result in denial of service (DoS) or, under certain conditions, remote code execution (RCE). Any application or system that relies on CryptoLib for Telecommand (TC) processing and does not strictly validate incoming TC frames is at risk. This includes satellite ground stations or mission control software where attackers can inject malformed frames.

A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in the `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted AOS frame with an insufficient length. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_AOS_ProcessSecurity`, specifically during the processing of the Frame Error Control Field (FECF). The affected code attempts to read from the `p_ingest` buffer at indices `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size - 2` and `current_managed_parameters_struct.max_frame_size - 1` without verifying if `len_ingest` is sufficiently large.

CVE-2025-29912,PUBLISHED,GitHub_M,2025-03-17T22:48:40.833Z,CryptoLib Has Heap Buffer Overflow Due to Unsigned Integer Underflow in Crypto_TC_ProcessSecurity,"CryptoLib provides a software-only solution using the CCSDS Space Data Link Security Protocol - Extended Procedures (SDLS-EP) to secure communications between a spacecraft running the core Flight System (cFS) and a ground station. In versions 1.3.3 and prior, an unsigned integer underflow in the `Crypto_TC_ProcessSecurity` function of CryptoLib leads to a heap buffer overflow. The vulnerability is triggered when the `fl` (frame length) field in a Telecommand (TC) packet is set to 0. This underflow causes the frame length to be interpreted as 65535, resulting in out-of-bounds memory access. This critical vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service (DoS) or potentially achieve remote code execution. Users of CryptoLib are advised to apply the recommended patch or avoid processing untrusted TC packets until a fix is available.",NASA,CryptoLib,hot

A critical heap buffer overflow vulnerability was identified in the `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD` function of CryptoLib versions 1.3.3 and prior. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code (RCE) by providing a maliciously crafted telecommand (TC) frame that causes an unsigned integer underflow. The vulnerability lies in the function `Crypto_TC_Prep_AAD`, specifically during the computation of `tc_mac_start_index`. The affected code incorrectly calculates the MAC start index without ensuring it remains within the bounds of the `ingest` buffer. When `tc_mac_start_index` underflows due to an incorrect length calculation, the function attempts to access an out-of-bounds memory location, leading to a segmentation fault.

CVE-2025-30165,PUBLISHED,GitHub_M,2025-05-06T16:53:52.836Z,Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in vLLM Multi-Node Cluster Configuration,"vLLM is an inference and serving engine for large language models. In a multi-node vLLM deployment using the V0 engine, vLLM uses ZeroMQ for some multi-node communication purposes. The secondary vLLM hosts open a `SUB` ZeroMQ socket and connect to an `XPUB` socket on the primary vLLM host. When data is received on this `SUB` socket, it is deserialized with `pickle`. This is unsafe, as it can be abused to execute code on a remote machine. Since the vulnerability exists in a client that connects to the primary vLLM host, this vulnerability serves as an escalation point. If the primary vLLM host is compromised, this vulnerability could be used to compromise the rest of the hosts in the vLLM deployment. Attackers could also use other means to exploit the vulnerability without requiring access to the primary vLLM host. One example would be the use of ARP cache poisoning to redirect traffic to a malicious endpoint used to deliver a payload with arbitrary code to execute on the target machine. Note that this issue only affects the V0 engine, which has been off by default since v0.8.0. Further, the issue only applies to a deployment using tensor parallelism across multiple hosts, which we do not expect to be a common deployment pattern. Since V0 is has been off by default since v0.8.0 and the fix is fairly invasive, the maintainers of vLLM have decided not to fix this issue. Instead, the maintainers recommend that users ensure their environment is on a secure network in case this pattern is in use. The V1 engine is not affected by this issue.",VLLM-PROJECT,vllm,hot

Additionally, it could also result in other severe consequences given the application's implementation, such as identity confusion, where an attacker could impersonate an assistant or system role within conversations. This impersonation could potentially enable jailbreak attacks when interacting with large language models (LLMs). Just like the Javascript's prototype pollution, this vulnerability could leave a way for attackers to manipulate the intended data-flow or control-flow of the application at runtime and lead to severe consequences like remote code execution when gadgets are available.

If there was an issue trying to put that new transaction on the wire, it would close the connection handle, but read_answers() was still expecting the connection handle to be available to possibly dequeue other responses.

This endpoint is intended to be admins-only, but it also authorizes requests from any device in the same local network as the Jellyfin server. Due to the method Jellyfin uses to determine the source IP of a request, an unauthenticated attacker is able to spoof their IP to appear as a LAN IP, allowing them to restart the Jellyfin server process without authentication. This means that an unauthenticated attacker could mount a denial-of-service attack on any default-configured Jellyfin server by simply sending the same spoofed request every few seconds to restart the server over and over. This method of IP spoofing also bypasses some security mechanisms, cause a denial-of-service attack, and possible bypass the admin restart requirement if combined with remote code execution.

CVE-2025-32441,PUBLISHED,GitHub_M,2025-05-07T23:01:19.722Z,Rack session gets restored after deletion,"Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Prior to version 2.2.14, when using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, simultaneous rack requests can restore a deleted rack session, which allows the unauthenticated user to occupy that session. Rack session middleware prepares the session at the beginning of request, then saves is back to the store with possible changes applied by host rack application. This way the session becomes to be a subject of race conditions in general sense over concurrent rack requests. When using the `Rack::Session::Pool` middleware, and provided the attacker can acquire a session cookie (already a major issue), the session may be restored if the attacker can trigger a long running request (within that same session) adjacent to the user logging out, in order to retain illicit access even after a user has attempted to logout. Version 2.2.14 contains a patch for the issue. Some other mitigations are available. Either ensure the application invalidates sessions atomically by marking them as logged out e.g., using a `logged_out` flag, instead of deleting them, and check this flag on every request to prevent reuse; or implement a custom session store that tracks session invalidation timestamps and refuses to accept session data if the session was invalidated after the request began.",RACK,rack,warm

A command injection vulnerability exists in the screenshot API of the Web Check project (Lissy93/web-check). The issue stems from user-controlled input (url) being passed unsanitized into a shell command using exec(), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary system commands on the underlying host. This could be exploited by sending crafted url parameters to extract files or even establish remote access. The vulnerability has been patched by replacing exec() with execFile(), which avoids using a shell and properly isolates arguments.",LISSY93,web-check,warm

In versions before 5.5.0, an attacker with access to the `/backup/import` API endpoint can write arbitrary files to locations outside the intended extraction directory due to a Zip Slip vulnerability. Although the application runs as a non-root user (`185`), limiting direct impact on system-level files, this vulnerability can still be exploited to overwrite application files (e.g., JAR libraries) owned by the application user. This overwrite can potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the application's context. This issue has been patched in version 5.5.0.",LABSAI,EDDI,warm
CVE-2025-32797,PUBLISHED,GitHub_M,2025-06-16T18:46:31.227Z,Conda-build Insecure Build Script Permissions Enabling Arbitrary Code Execution,"Conda-build contains commands and tools to build conda packages. Prior to version 25.3.1, the write_build_scripts function in conda-build creates the temporary build script conda_build.sh with overly permissive file permissions (0o766), allowing write access to all users. Attackers with filesystem access can exploit a race condition to overwrite the script before execution, enabling arbitrary code execution under the victim's privileges. This risk is significant in shared environments, potentially leading to full system compromise. Even with non-static directory names, attackers can monitor parent directories for file creation events. The brief window between script creation (with insecure permissions) and execution allows rapid overwrites. Directory names can also be inferred via timestamps or logs, and automation enables exploitation even with semi-randomized paths by acting within milliseconds of detection. This issue has been patched in version 25.3.1. A workaround involves restricting conda_build.sh permissions from 0o766 to 0o700 (owner-only read/write/execute). Additionally, use atomic file creation (write to a temporary randomized filename and rename atomically) to minimize the race condition window.",CONDA,conda-build,hot

Prior to version 25.4.0, the conda-build recipe processing logic has been found to be vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to unsafe evaluation of recipe selectors. Currently, conda-build uses the eval function to process embedded selectors in meta.yaml files. This approach evaluates user-defined expressions without proper sanitization, which allows arbitrary code to be executed during the build process. As a result, the integrity of the build environment is compromised, and unauthorized commands or file operations may be performed. The vulnerability stems from the inherent risk of using eval() on untrusted input in a context intended to control dynamic build configurations. By directly interpreting selector expressions, conda-build creates a potential execution pathway for malicious code, violating security assumptions. This issue has been patched in version 25.4.0.",CONDA,conda-build,hot

fs/jfs: Prevent integer overflow in AG size calculation

The JFS filesystem calculates allocation group (AG) size using 1 <<
l2agsize in dbExtendFS(). When l2agsize exceeds 31 (possible with >2TB
aggregates on 32-bit systems), this 32-bit shift operation causes undefined
behavior and improper AG sizing.

On 32-bit architectures:
- Left-shifting 1 by 32+ bits results in 0 due to integer overflow
- This creates invalid AG sizes (0 or garbage values) in
sbi->bmap->db_agsize
- Subsequent block allocations would reference invalid AG structures
- Could lead to:
  - Filesystem corruption during extend operations
  - Kernel crashes due to invalid memory accesses
  - Security vulnerabilities via malformed on-disk structures

Fix by casting to s64 before shifting:
bmp->db_agsize = (s64)1 << l2agsize;

This ensures 64-bit arithmetic even on 32-bit architectures. The cast
matches the data type of db_agsize (s64) and follows similar patterns in

PCI: endpoint: pci-epf-test: Fix double free that causes kernel to oops

Fix a kernel oops found while testing the stm32_pcie Endpoint driver

During EP initialization, pci_epf_test_alloc_space() allocates all BARs,
which are further freed if epc_set_bar() fails (for instance, due to no
free inbound window).

However, when pci_epc_set_bar() fails, the error path:

  pci_epc_set_bar() ->

Then, if the host reboots, the PERST# deassertion restarts the BAR
allocation sequence with the same allocation failure (no free inbound
window), creating a double free situation since epf_test->reg[bar] was
deallocated and is still non-NULL.

Thus, make sure that pci_epf_alloc_space() and pci_epf_free_space()
invocations are symmetric, and as such, set epf_test->reg[bar] to NULL

There is a potential crash issue when disabling and re-enabling the

device_link_del() to remove the device link, but it does not clear
phydev->devlink, so phydev->devlink is not a NULL pointer. Then the
network port is re-enabled, but if phy_attach_direct() fails before
calling device_link_add(), the code jumps to the ""error"" label and
calls phy_detach(). Since phydev->devlink retains the old value from
the previous attach/detach cycle, device_link_del() uses the old value,
which accesses a NULL pointer and causes a crash. The simplified crash

erofs: avoid using multiple devices with different type

For multiple devices, both primary and extra devices should be the

However, if the primary is a block device while the extra device

leads to an UAF:

nvme-tcp: remove tag set when second admin queue config fails

Commit 104d0e2f6222 (""nvme-fabrics: reset admin connection for secure
concatenation"") modified nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() to call
nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() twice. The first call prepares for
DH-CHAP negotitation, and the second call is required for secure
concatenation. However, this change triggered BUG KASAN slab-use-after-
free in blk_mq_queue_tag_busy_iter(). This BUG can be recreated by
repeating the blktests test case nvme/063 a few times [1].

When the BUG happens, nvme_tcp_create_ctrl() fails in the call chain
below:

nvme_tcp_create_ctrl()
 nvme_tcp_alloc_ctrl() new=true             ... Alloc nvme_tcp_ctrl and admin_tag_set
 nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() new=true
  nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() new=true ... Succeed
   nvme_alloc_admin_tag_set()               ... Alloc the tag set for admin_tag_set

 nvme_uninit_ctrl()
 nvme_put_ctrl()                            ... Free up the nvme_tcp_ctrl and admin_tag_set

The first call of nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() succeeds with
new=true argument. The second call fails with new=false argument. This
second call does not call nvme_remove_admin_tag_set() on failure, due to
the new=false argument. Then the admin tag set is not removed. However,
nvme_tcp_create_ctrl() assumes that nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() would call
nvme_remove_admin_tag_set(). Then it frees up struct nvme_tcp_ctrl which
has admin_tag_set field. Later on, the timeout handler accesses the
admin_tag_set field and causes the BUG KASAN slab-use-after-free.

To not leave the admin tag set, call nvme_remove_admin_tag_set() when
the second nvme_tcp_configure_admin_queue() call fails. Do not return
from nvme_tcp_setup_ctrl() on failure. Instead, jump to ""destroy_admin""

pinctrl: mediatek: eint: Fix invalid pointer dereference for v1 platforms

Commit 3ef9f710efcb (""pinctrl: mediatek: Add EINT support for multiple
addresses"") introduced an access to the 'soc' field of struct
mtk_pinctrl in mtk_eint_do_init() and for that an include of
pinctrl-mtk-common-v2.h.

However, pinctrl drivers relying on the v1 common driver include
pinctrl-mtk-common.h instead, which provides another definition of
struct mtk_pinctrl that does not contain an 'soc' field.

Since mtk_eint_do_init() can be called both by v1 and v2 drivers, it
will now try to dereference an invalid pointer when called on v1
platforms. This has been observed on Genio 350 EVK (MT8365), which
crashes very early in boot (the kernel trace can only be seen with
earlycon).

In order to fix this, since 'struct mtk_pinctrl' was only needed to get
a 'struct mtk_eint_pin', make 'struct mtk_eint_pin' a parameter
of mtk_eint_do_init() so that callers need to supply it, removing

net: ethernet: cortina: Use TOE/TSO on all TCP

It is desireable to push the hardware accelerator to also
process non-segmented TCP frames: we pass the skb->len
to the ""TOE/TSO"" offloader and it will handle them.

Without this quirk the driver becomes unstable and lock
up and and crash.

I do not know exactly why, but it is probably due to the
TOE (TCP offload engine) feature that is coupled with the
segmentation feature - it is not possible to turn one
part off and not the other, either both TOE and TSO are
active, or neither of them.

Not having the TOE part active seems detrimental, as if
that hardware feature is not really supposed to be turned
off.

The datasheet says:

  ""Based on packet parsing and TCP connection/NAT table
   lookup results, the NetEngine puts the packets
   belonging to the same TCP connection to the same queue
   for the software to process. The NetEngine puts
   incoming packets to the buffer or series of buffers
   for a jumbo packet. With this hardware acceleration,
   IP/TCP header parsing, checksum validation and
   connection lookup are offloaded from the software
   processing.""

 - USB gadget is enabled as Ethernet

 - Device is going in/out suspend (echo mem > /sys/power/state)

The root cause is the USB device controller is suspended but the USB bus
is still active which caused the USB host continues to transfer data with
device and the device continues to queue USB requests (in this case, a
delayed TCP ACK packet trigger the issue) after controller is suspended,
however the USB controller clock is already gated off. Then if udc driver
access registers after that point, the system will hang.

The correct way to avoid such issue is to disconnect device from host when
the USB bus is not at suspend state. Then the host will receive disconnect
event and stop data transfer in time. To continue make USB gadget device
work after system resume, this will reconnect device automatically.

To make usb wakeup work if USB bus is already at suspend state, this will
keep connection for it only when USB device controller has enabled wakeup

Squashfs: check return result of sb_min_blocksize

Syzkaller reports an ""UBSAN: shift-out-of-bounds in squashfs_bio_read"" bug.

Syzkaller forks multiple processes which after mounting the Squashfs
filesystem, issues an ioctl(""/dev/loop0"", LOOP_SET_BLOCK_SIZE, 0x8000). 
Now if this ioctl occurs at the same time another process is in the
process of mounting a Squashfs filesystem on /dev/loop0, the failure
occurs.  When this happens the following code in squashfs_fill_super()
fails.

----
msblk->devblksize = sb_min_blocksize(sb, SQUASHFS_DEVBLK_SIZE);
msblk->devblksize_log2 = ffz(~msblk->devblksize);
----

sb_min_blocksize() returns 0, which means msblk->devblksize is set to 0.

As a result, ffz(~msblk->devblksize) returns 64, and msblk->devblksize_log2
is set to 64.

This subsequently causes the

net/mlx5e: Fix race between DIM disable and net_dim()

There's a race between disabling DIM and NAPI callbacks using the dim
pointer on the RQ or SQ.

If NAPI checks the DIM state bit and sees it still set, it assumes
`rq->dim` or `sq->dim` is valid. But if DIM gets disabled right after
that check, the pointer might already be set to NULL, leading to a NULL
pointer dereference in net_dim().

Fix this by calling `synchronize_net()` before freeing the DIM context.
This ensures all in-progress NAPI callbacks are finished before the
pointer is cleared.

tcp: Correct signedness in skb remaining space calculation

Syzkaller reported a bug [1] where sk->sk_forward_alloc can overflow.

When we send data, if an skb exists at the tail of the write queue, the
kernel will attempt to append the new data to that skb. However, the code
that checks for available space in the skb is flawed:
'''
copy = size_goal - skb->len
'''

The types of the variables involved are:
'''
copy: ssize_t (s64 on 64-bit systems)
size_goal: int
skb->len: unsigned int
'''

Due to C's type promotion rules, the signed size_goal is converted to an
unsigned int to match skb->len before the subtraction. The result is an
unsigned int.

When this unsigned int result is then assigned to the s64 copy variable,
it is zero-extended, preserving its non-negative value. Consequently, copy
is always >= 0.

Assume we are sending 2GB of data and size_goal has been adjusted to a
value smaller than skb->len. The subtraction will result in copy holding a
very large positive integer. In the subsequent logic, this large value is
used to update sk->sk_forward_alloc, which can easily cause it to overflow.

The syzkaller reproducer uses TCP_REPAIR to reliably create this
condition. However, this can also occur in real-world scenarios. The
tcp_bound_to_half_wnd() function can also reduce size_goal to a small
value. This would cause the subsequent tcp_wmem_schedule() to set
sk->sk_forward_alloc to a value close to INT_MAX. Further memory
allocation requests would then cause sk_forward_alloc to wrap around and
become negative.

smb: client: fix use-after-free in crypt_message when using async crypto

The CVE-2024-50047 fix removed asynchronous crypto handling from
crypt_message(), assuming all crypto operations are synchronous.
However, when hardware crypto accelerators are used, this can cause
use-after-free crashes:

  crypt_message()
    // Allocate the creq buffer containing the req
    creq = smb2_get_aead_req(..., &req);

    // Async encryption returns -EINPROGRESS immediately
    rc = enc ? crypto_aead_encrypt(req) : crypto_aead_decrypt(req);

    // Free creq while async operation is still in progress
    kvfree_sensitive(creq, ...);

Hardware crypto modules often implement async AEAD operations for
performance. When crypto_aead_encrypt/decrypt() returns -EINPROGRESS,
the operation completes asynchronously. Without crypto_wait_req(),
the function immediately frees the request buffer, leading to crashes
when the driver later accesses the freed memory.

This results in a use-after-free condition when the hardware crypto
driver later accesses the freed request structure, leading to kernel
crashes with NULL pointer dereferences.

The issue occurs because crypto_alloc_aead() with mask=0 doesn't
guarantee synchronous operation. Even without CRYPTO_ALG_ASYNC in
the mask, async implementations can be selected.

Fix by restoring the async crypto handling:
- DECLARE_CRYPTO_WAIT(wait) for completion tracking
- aead_request_set_callback() for async completion notification
- crypto_wait_req() to wait for operation completion

This ensures the request buffer isn't freed until the crypto operation
completes, whether synchronous or asynchronous, while preserving the

bpf: Fix oob access in cgroup local storage

can be crafted via tail calls. Given two programs each utilizing a
cgroup local storage with a different value size, and one program
doing a tail call into the other. The verifier will validate each of
the indivial programs just fine. However, in the runtime context
the bpf_cg_run_ctx holds an bpf_prog_array_item which contains the
BPF program as well as any cgroup local storage flavor the program
uses. Helpers such as bpf_get_local_storage() pick this up from the
runtime context:

  ctx = container_of(current->bpf_ctx, struct bpf_cg_run_ctx, run_ctx);

net/sched: Restrict conditions for adding duplicating netems to qdisc tree

netem_enqueue's duplication prevention logic breaks when a netem
resides in a qdisc tree with other netems - this can lead to a
soft lockup and OOM loop in netem_dequeue, as seen in [1].
Ensure that a duplicating netem cannot exist in a tree with other
netems.

Previous approaches suggested in discussions in chronological order:

1) Track duplication status or ttl in the sk_buff struct. Considered
too specific a use case to extend such a struct, though this would
be a resilient fix and address other previous and potential future
DOS bugs like the one described in loopy fun [2].

2) Restrict netem_enqueue recursion depth like in act_mirred with a
per cpu variable. However, netem_dequeue can call enqueue on its
child, and the depth restriction could be bypassed if the child is a
netem.

3) Use the same approach as in 2, but add metadata in netem_skb_cb
to handle the netem_dequeue case and track a packet's involvement
in duplication. This is an overly complex approach, and Jamal
notes that the skb cb can be overwritten to circumvent this
safeguard.

4) Prevent the addition of a netem to a qdisc tree if its ancestral
path contains a netem. However, filters and actions can cause a
packet to change paths when re-enqueued to the root from netem
duplication, leading us to the current solution: prevent a
duplicating netem from inhabiting the same tree as other netems.

perf/core: Prevent VMA split of buffer mappings

The perf mmap code is careful about mmap()'ing the user page with the
ringbuffer and additionally the auxiliary buffer, when the event supports
it. Once the first mapping is established, subsequent mapping have to use
the same offset and the same size in both cases. The reference counting for
the ringbuffer and the auxiliary buffer depends on this being correct.

Though perf does not prevent that a related mapping is split via mmap(2),
munmap(2) or mremap(2). A split of a VMA results in perf_mmap_open() calls,
which take reference counts, but then the subsequent perf_mmap_close()
calls are not longer fulfilling the offset and size checks. This leads to
reference count leaks.

As perf already has the requirement for subsequent mappings to match the
initial mapping, the obvious consequence is that VMA splits, caused by
resizing of a mapping or partial unmapping, have to be prevented.

Implement the vm_operations_struct::may_split() callback and return
unconditionally -EINVAL.

That ensures that the mapping offsets and sizes cannot be changed after the
fact. Remapping to a different fixed address with the same size is still

perf/core: Handle buffer mapping fail correctly in perf_mmap()

After successful allocation of a buffer or a successful attachment to an
existing buffer perf_mmap() tries to map the buffer read only into the page
table. If that fails, the already set up page table entries are zapped, but
the other perf specific side effects of that failure are not handled.  The
calling code just cleans up the VMA and does not invoke perf_mmap_close().

This leaks reference counts, corrupts user->vm accounting and also results
in an unbalanced invocation of event::event_mapped().

Cure this by moving the event::event_mapped() invocation before the
map_range() call so that on map_range() failure perf_mmap_close() can be
invoked without causing an unbalanced event::event_unmapped() call.

perf_mmap_close() undoes the reference counts and eventually frees buffers.",LINUX,Linux,hot

nvmet: pci-epf: Do not complete commands twice if nvmet_req_init() fails

Have nvmet_req_init() and req->execute() complete failed commands.

Description of the problem:
nvmet_req_init() calls __nvmet_req_complete() internally upon failure,
e.g., unsupported opcode, which calls the ""queue_response"" callback,
this results in nvmet_pci_epf_queue_response() being called, which will
call nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() if data_len is 0 or if dma_dir is
different from DMA_TO_DEVICE. This results in a double completion as
nvmet_pci_epf_exec_iod_work() also calls nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod()
when nvmet_req_init() fails.

Steps to reproduce:
On the host send a command with an unsupported opcode with nvme-cli,
For example the admin command ""security receive""
$ sudo nvme security-recv /dev/nvme0n1 -n1 -x4096

This triggers a double completion as nvmet_req_init() fails and
nvmet_pci_epf_queue_response() is called, here iod->dma_dir is still
in the default state of ""DMA_NONE"" as set by default in
nvmet_pci_epf_alloc_iod(), so nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() is called.
Because nvmet_req_init() failed nvmet_pci_epf_complete_iod() is also
called in nvmet_pci_epf_exec_iod_work() leading to a double completion.
This not only sends two completions to the host but also corrupts the
state of the PCI NVMe target leading to kernel oops.

This patch lets nvmet_req_init() and req->execute() complete all failed
commands, and removes the double completion case in
nvmet_pci_epf_exec_iod_work() therefore fixing the edge cases where
double completions occurred.",LINUX,Linux,hot

This vulnerability is a confirmed HTTP response splitting flaw in CGI::Simple that allows HTTP response header injection, which can be used for reflected XSS or open redirect under certain conditions.

Although some validation exists, it can be bypassed using URL-encoded values, allowing an attacker to inject untrusted content into the response via query parameters.



As a result, an attacker can inject a line break (e.g. %0A) into the parameter value, causing the server to split the HTTP response and inject arbitrary headers or even an HTML/JavaScript body, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), open redirect or other attacks.

The issue documented in CVE-2010-4410 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-4410 is related but the fix was incomplete.

Impact

By injecting %0A (newline) into a query string parameter, an attacker can:

  *  Break the current HTTP header
  *  Inject a new header or entire body
  *  Deliver a script payload that is reflected in the server’s response
That can lead to the following attacks:

  *  reflected XSS
  *  open redirect
  *  cache poisoning
  *  header manipulation",MANWAR,CGI::Simple,warm

First, the victim must extract an archive that contains a ../ symlink to a critical directory. Second, the victim must extract an archive that contains a critical file, specified via a relative pathname that begins with the symlink name and ends with that critical file's name. Here, the extraction follows the symlink and overwrites the critical file. This bypasses the protection mechanism of ""Member name contains '..'"" that would occur for a single TAR archive that attempted to specify the critical file via a ../ approach. For example, the first archive can contain ""x -> ../../../../../home/victim/.ssh"" and the second archive can contain x/authorized_keys. This can affect server applications that automatically extract any number of user-supplied TAR archives, and were relying on the blocking of traversal. This can also affect software installation processes in which ""tar xf"" is run more than once (e.g., when installing a package can automatically install two dependencies that are set up as untrusted tarballs instead of official packages).

In versions 1.14.1 and below, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists due to improper handling of JMESPath variable substitutions. Attackers with permissions to create or update Kyverno policies can craft expressions using the {{@}} variable combined with a pipe and an invalid JMESPath function (e.g., {{@ | non_existent_function }}). This leads to a nil value being substituted into the policy structure. Subsequent processing by internal functions, specifically getValueAsStringMap, which expect string values, results in a panic due to a type assertion failure (interface {} is nil, not string).

CVE-2025-47950,PUBLISHED,GitHub_M,2025-06-06T17:32:30.218Z,CoreDNS Vulnerable to DoQ Memory Exhaustion via Stream Amplification,"CoreDNS is a DNS server that chains plugins. In versions prior to 1.12.2, a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability exists in the CoreDNS DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) server implementation. The server previously created a new goroutine for every incoming QUIC stream without imposing any limits on the number of concurrent streams or goroutines. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could open a large number of streams, leading to uncontrolled memory consumption and eventually causing an Out Of Memory (OOM) crash — especially in containerized or memory-constrained environments. The patch in version 1.12.2 introduces two key mitigation mechanisms: `max_streams`, which caps the number of concurrent QUIC streams per connection with a default value of `256`; and `worker_pool_size`, which Introduces a server-wide, bounded worker pool to process incoming streams with a default value of `1024`. This eliminates the 1:1 stream-to-goroutine model and ensures that CoreDNS remains resilient under high concurrency.  Some workarounds are available for those who are unable to upgrade. Disable QUIC support by removing or commenting out the `quic://` block in the Corefile, use container runtime resource limits to detect and isolate excessive memory usage, and/or monitor QUIC connection patterns and alert on anomalies.",COREDNS,coredns,hot

CVE-2025-48384,PUBLISHED,GitHub_M,2025-07-08T18:23:48.710Z,Git allows arbitrary code execution through broken config quoting,"Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When reading a config value, Git strips any trailing carriage return and line feed (CRLF). When writing a config entry, values with a trailing CR are not quoted, causing the CR to be lost when the config is later read. When initializing a submodule, if the submodule path contains a trailing CR, the altered path is read resulting in the submodule being checked out to an incorrect location. If a symlink exists that points the altered path to the submodule hooks directory, and the submodule contains an executable post-checkout hook, the script may be unintentionally executed after checkout. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.",GIT,git,hot
CVE-2025-48385,PUBLISHED,GitHub_M,2025-07-08T18:23:44.405Z,Git alllows arbitrary file writes via bundle-uri parameter injection,"Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations and full access to internals. When cloning a repository Git knows to optionally fetch a bundle advertised by the remote server, which allows the server-side to offload parts of the clone to a CDN. The Git client does not perform sufficient validation of the advertised bundles, which allows the remote side to perform protocol injection. This protocol injection can cause the client to write the fetched bundle to a location controlled by the adversary. The fetched content is fully controlled by the server, which can in the worst case lead to arbitrary code execution. The use of bundle URIs is not enabled by default and can be controlled by the bundle.heuristic config option. Some cases of the vulnerability require that the adversary is in control of where a repository will be cloned to. This either requires social engineering or a recursive clone with submodules. These cases can thus be avoided by disabling recursive clones. This vulnerability is fixed in v2.43.7, v2.44.4, v2.45.4, v2.46.4, v2.47.3, v2.48.2, v2.49.1, and v2.50.1.",GIT,git,hot

Prior to version 25.6.7, a vulnerability in the authentication logic allows users to bypass password verification using SHA-256 magic hashes, due to loose comparison in PHP. In vulnerable versions of the application, a password comparison is performed using the `==` operator at line 40 in front/index.php. This introduces a security issue where specially crafted ""magic hash"" values that evaluate to true in a loose comparison can bypass authentication. Because of the use of `==` instead of the strict `===`, different strings that begin with 0e and are followed by only digits can be interpreted as scientific notation (i.e., zero) and treated as equal. This issue falls under the Login Bypass vulnerability class. Users with certain ""weird"" passwords that produce magic hashes are particularly affected. Services relying on this logic are at risk of unauthorized access. Version 25.6.7 fixes the vulnerability.",JOKOB-SK,NetAlertX,hot

Prior to version 11.0.0, an authenticated Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the HAXCMS saveOutline endpoint allows a low-privileged user to read arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the location field written into site.json. This enables attackers to exfiltrate sensitive system files such as /etc/passwd, application secrets, or configuration files accessible to the web server (www-data). The vulnerability stems from the way the HAXCMS backend handles the location field in the site's outline. When a user sends a POST request to /system/api/saveOutline, the backend stores the provided location value directly into the site.json file associated with the site, without validating or sanitizing the input. Later the location parameter is interpreted by the CMS to resolve and load the content for a given node.

Specifically, unchecked return values in mbedtls_lms_verify allow an attacker (who can induce a hardware hash accelerator fault) to bypass LMS signature verification by reusing stale stack data, resulting in acceptance of an invalid signature. In mbedtls_lms_verify, the return values of the internal Merkle tree functions create_merkle_leaf_value and create_merkle_internal_value are not checked. These functions return an integer that indicates whether the call succeeded or not. If a failure occurs, the output buffer (Tc_candidate_root_node) may remain uninitialized, and the result of the signature verification is unpredictable.

The project-specific MCP configuration for the Roo Code agent is stored in the `.roo/mcp.json` file within the VS Code workspace. Because the MCP configuration format allows for execution of arbitrary commands, prior to version 3.20.3, it would have been possible for an attacker with access to craft a prompt to ask the agent to write a malicious command to the MCP configuration file. If the user had opted-in to auto-approving file writes within the project, this would have led to arbitrary command execution. This issue is of moderate severity, since it requires the attacker to already be able to submit prompts to the agent (for instance through a prompt injection attack), for the user to have MCP enabled (on by default), and for the user to have enabled auto-approved file writes (off by default). Version 3.20.3 fixes the issue by adding an additional layer of opt-in configuration for auto-approving writing to Roo's configuration files, including all files within the `.roo/` folder.",ROOCODEINC,Roo-Code,warm

CVE-2025-53888,PUBLISHED,GitHub_M,2025-07-18T15:32:15.856Z,RIOT-OS has an ineffective size check that can lead to buffer overflow in link layer address filter /sys/net/link_layer/l2filter/l2filter.c,"RIOT-OS, an operating system that supports Internet of Things devices, has an ineffective size check implemented with `assert()` can lead to buffer overflow in versions up to and including 2025.04. Assertions are usually compiled out in production builds. If assertions are the only defense against untrusted inputs, the software may be exposed to attacks that utilize the lack of proper input checks. In the `l2filter_add()` function shown below, `addr_len` is checked using an assertion and is subsequently used as an argument in a `memcpy()` call. When assertions are disabled, there would be no size check for `addr_len`. As a consequence, if an attacker were to provide an `addr_len` value larger than `CONFIG_L2FILTER_ADDR_MAXLEN`, they can trigger a buffer overflow and write past the `list[i].addr` buffer. If the unchecked input is attacker-controlled, the impact of the buffer overflow can range from a denial of service to arbitrary code execution.

CVE-2025-8597,PUBLISHED,CERT-PL,2025-08-26T12:23:01.180Z,Privilege Escalation via get-task-allow entitlement in MacVim.app,"MacVim's configuration on macOS, specifically the presence of entitlement ""com.apple.security.get-task-allow"", allows local attackers with unprivileged access (e.g. via a malicious application) to attach a debugger, read or modify the process memory, inject code in the application's context despite being signed with Hardened Runtime and bypass Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC). Acquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Access to other resources beyond granted permissions requires user interaction with a system prompt asking for permission.

According to Apple documentation, when a non-root user runs an app with the debugging tool entitlement, the system presents an authorization dialog asking for a system administrator's credentials. Since there is no prompt when the target process has ""get-task-allow"" entitlement, the presence of this entitlement was decided to be treated as a vulnerability because it removes one step needed to perform an attack.

CVE-2025-8700,PUBLISHED,CERT-PL,2025-08-26T12:23:04.838Z,Privilege Escalation via get-task-allow entitlement in Invoice Ninja,"Invoice Ninja's configuration on macOS, specifically the presence of entitlement ""com.apple.security.get-task-allow"", allows local attackers with unprivileged access (e.g. via a malicious application) to attach a debugger, read or modify the process memory, inject code in the application's context despite being signed with Hardened Runtime and bypass Transparency, Consent, and Control (TCC). Acquired resource access is limited to previously granted permissions by the user. Access to other resources beyond granted permissions requires user interaction with a system prompt asking for permission.

According to Apple documentation, when a non-root user runs an app with the debugging tool entitlement, the system presents an authorization dialog asking for a system administrator's credentials. Since there is no prompt when the target process has ""get-task-allow"" entitlement, the presence of this entitlement was decided to be treated as a vulnerability because it removes one step needed to perform an attack.
